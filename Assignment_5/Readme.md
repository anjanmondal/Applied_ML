# Assignment Overview

This assignment involves two tasks: Transfer Learning for Image Data Using CNN and Transfer Learning for Text Data Using Transformer. Below are the steps involved in each task.

## Transfer Learning for Image Data Using CNN

1. **Data Collection**: Download approximately 500 images of ducks and 500 images of chickens from the internet.

2. **Google Colab Notebook Setup**: Set up a Google Colab notebook environment for running the code.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Organize the images into separate folders for ducks and chickens.

4. **Model Building**: Fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. Use a pre-trained model like ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet.

5. **Model Training**: Train the fine-tuned CNN model on the collected images.

6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set and output the classification report showing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classifying ducks vs. chickens.

## Transfer Learning for Text Data Using Transformer

1. **Data Collection**: Download the sentiment analysis dataset from Kaggle.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data. Handle missing values, tokenize the text, and perform other text preprocessing steps.

3. **Model Building**: Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model like BERT for text classification. Use libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers to load the pre-trained BERT model.

4. **Model Training**: Train the fine-tuned transformer model on the sentiment analysis dataset.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set and print the classification report showing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classifying sentiment into positive, neutral, and negative categories.
