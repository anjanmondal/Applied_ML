subject  hurricane warning derivative folk  this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of product  it is clear that numerous entity have underlying exposure to hurricane warning frequency and  or duration  it is our objective to develop derivative product that will enable these entity to effectively hedge this exposure  we have generated a partial brainstorm  style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure  pro  hurricane anti  hurricane the weather channel resort home depot cruise ship lowes riverboat casino cnn chemical plant and refinery local tv station u  s armed force dry ice manufacturer athletic team chainsaw manufacturer city government insect repellant manufacturer state government it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting party but it is important to note that the pro  hurricane entity are more macro in nature while the anti  hurricane entity are typically more regional  thus  we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti  hurricane entity would be interested in regional product and the pro  hurricane entity would likely be more interested in bundled regional product depending on their exposure  thus far  we have collected and documented all u  s hurricane warning data from    in the form of an excel database  the data can be sorted by year  storm  or location on the u  s coastline  total hurricane warning duration a well a number of discrete hurricane warning are the primary data set of interest for any given location  or year or storm   the u  s coast ha been divided into  different geographic region of roughly similar size  these region are  new england  mid  atlantic  virginia  north carolina  georgia  south carolina  east florida  west florida  florida panhandle  orleans  miss  bama  lousiana  and texas  while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purpose  it ha confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration is quite volatile and unpredictable  it is believed that this volaility  when graphically depicted and mathematically represented  could be used to effectively demonstrate to would  be customer the impact of hurricane warning frequency on their business financials  in many case  business may be well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly probably felt a if this wa a risk they would have to wear themselves  a we move forward on the modeling front  the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factor such a political trend  satellite availability  population trend  etc  additionally  we need to go further back in time so long a the accuracy doesn  t decline  on the marketing front  i am certainly open to idea  it is believed the weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product  given our positive relationship that we currently have with them  they might be the easiest sell  any and all idea are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customer  please respond with any question  comment or concern on this project  thanks  charlie,0

subject  re  var vince thanks for the update  especially your point  which echo our own discussion yesterday  i want to clarify responsibility for maintenance and administration of var  we need transparency around the process so that mapping decision  for example  are easily made  supported and reviewed  it became clear after last friday  s event  that we are in an awkward paradigm with respect to how we handle var here  particularly at  pressure point   i am putting together the scope of a  general overhaul  of the var process  including method and administration  to which i hope we would all buy in  so be assured of our co  operation  dp      original message      from  kaminski  vince sent  wednesday  april       pm to  port  david cc  lavorato  john  kaminski  vince  tamarchenko  tanya subject  var david  during today  s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issue related to mapping of the forward price curve into core location  mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitation of the computer system  we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bound of available cpu memory  also  in some case the quality of price discovery is poor and it  s difficult to model the price curve independently  we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core location curve  we have agreed on the following    winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curve that are simulated a basic  core  curve  he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curve on the time required to complete the var run    the curve associated with the biggest    position in each commodity should be modeled a core curve  i  e  no mapping into other location   it make sense to monitor the biggest risk separately and avoid aggregating them into le transparent aggregate    the result of an automated clustering  mapping  procedure should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risk of the trading position  this responsibility should be vested with one person  right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this mean in practice that nobody is responsible   research can allocate one person to this task  cooperation of trading and rac will be critical  vince,0

voicemail that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel  i  m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week  s time when my ear ha cleared up  and i look forward to meeting with you one day  i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour  but i  m not sure ifhe is there in houston  i know that you guy are probably very busy but i wa wondering if you can write a few sentence for me  i  m sending out some sample chapter to the people who responded positively  all of them   to my request for some feedback on the book  chapter  ha an  overview  of the book with just a couple of sentence on each chapter  could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter  i  m including what i have already written  although i think it ha changed slightly from this version  so that you can see the style  many thanks and best regard  chris   overview of this book this book aim to provide an in  depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivative  in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principal needed to model and price energy asset  and which underlie the rest of the book  a well a introducing the technique that underlie the black  scholes modelling framework we discus the numerical technique of trinomial tree and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book  in chapter  we analyse spot energy price  apart from describing empirical price we propose a number of process that can be used to model the price  we look at the well  know process of gbm a well a mean reversion  stochastic volatility and jump process  discussing each  and showing how they can be simulated and their parameter estimated  chapter   written by vince kaminski  grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corporation  discus volatility estimation in energy commodity market  this chapter build on the previous one  it examines in detail the method  merit and pitfall of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing model introduced in chapter   example from crude  gas  and electricity market are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspect of calculating volatility  chapter  examines forward curve in the energy market  although such curve are well understood and straight forward in the world debt market the difficulty of storage in many energy market lead to le well defined curve  what we do in this chapter chapter  present an overview of the common and not  so  common derivative structure in the energy market and discus their us  example of product analysed in this chapter include a variety of swap  cap  floor and collar  a well a energy swaptions  compound option  asian  or average rate  option  barrier  lookbacks  and ladder option  chapter  investigates single and multi  factor model of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivative  closed form solution for forward price  forward volatility  and european option price are derived and presented for all the model in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jump  chapter  show how the price of path dependent and american style option can be evaluated for the model in chapter   simulation scheme are developed for the evaluation of european style option and applied to a variety of path dependent option  in order to price option which incorporate early exercise opportunity  a trinomial tree scheme is developed  this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic a well a standard american style option  chapter  develops a new methodology for valuing energy option based on modelling the market observed forward curve  the approach result in a multi  factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curve and where the user defined volatility structure can be of an extremely general form  closed  form solution are developed for pricing standard european option and efficient monte carlo scheme for exotic option  the chapter finish with a discussion of the valuation of american style option  chapter  focus on the risk management of energy derivative position  in this chapter we discus the management of price risk for institution that sell option or other derivative to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time  we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivative and look at extension to gamma hedging  using the model from chapter  and   the general model of chapter  ideally suited to multi  factor hedging and this is also discussed  chapter  look at the key risk  management concept of value at risk applied to portfolio containing energy derivative portfolio  after discussing the concept of the measure  we look at how the key input  volatility  covariance  correlation  etc  can be estimated  we then compare the four major methodology for computing var  delta  delta  gamma  historical simulation and monte  carlo simulation  finally  we look at testing the var estimate for various underlying energy market variable ,0

subject  the storage revolution ha begun network world fusion focus  amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today  s focus  the storage revolution ha begun      dear wincenty kaminski  today  s focus  the storage revolution ha begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype  we are in the middle of a storage revolution  virtually overnight  business have gone from storing gigabyte to terabyte of data  and the number of user accessing that information is skyrocketing  the subsequent requirement are forcing company to rethink their storage strategy and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery  it isn   t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demand that are changing how business handle storage  the premium that company place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirement  business demand fault  tolerant storage system that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employee  supplier and customer  but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirement  on average  double every  month  while processor speed double every  month  company are left with a quandary  how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirement and processor speed  the simple answer to this question is to institute a well  executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirement in advance and leverage the best technology and technique to support those need  bear in mind that the majority of storage cost come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those system  there are several way to efficiently manage storage  one of the best route is consolidation that is  pooling resource and managing storage a a system  a opposed to a decentralized collection of file server  this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era  when enterprise storage resided on mainframe  but it   s actually a progressive step  a the consolidation ha more to do with centralizing the planning  management  and ongoing support of storage system than it doe with the physical location of the file  next  it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization  consequently  storage requirement vary by business application  a in all area of it  it is important to make storage implementation decision based on business need  business trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternative to the distributed file server storage model  they want to speed access to stored file and remove bandwidth  intensive backup and recovery operation from the lan  network  attached storage  na  supply it professional with one answer  giving workstation and server a way to gain direct access to stored data  na device  which have been widely available for year  are optimized to process i  o transaction  though they promise better performance  they don   t remove backup from the transport network  instead  they supply a relatively easy  to  deploy solution to cross  platform storage problem for most heterogeneous environment  many consider storage  area network  san  to be the best long  term answer to current and future storage challenge  because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network  they alleviate many of the availability and performance issue associated with more traditional storage model  yet  given the early deployment stage most company are still in  many of those capability are still largely untested in a production environment  this newsletter will examine how  through effective storage management  it professional can reduce support cost and improve service delivery to their customer  this newsletter will not focus on item like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library  instead  it will look at how business can reduce inefficiency and leverage emerging technology to resolve their particular storage application issue  ultimately  the goal is to identify storage technology option and practice that work in real  world

background on the ietf working group  rtfm wg  realtime traffic flow measurement rtfm is concerned with passive measurement of two  way traffic flow  specified in term of their end  point attribute  it primary goal wa to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the following need  a  wider range of measurable quantity  e  g  those relating to ipv   and to class of service b  simpler way to specify flow of interest c  better way to control access to measured flow data d  strong focus on data reduction capability e  efficient hardware implementation  ippm wg  ip performance measurement the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metric that can be applied to the quality  performance  and reliability of internet data delivery service  these metric will be designed such that they can be performed by network operator  end user  or independent testing group  it is important that the metric not represent a value judgement  i  e  define  good  and  bad

clearly a hard problem  e  g  doe this just mean response  time measurement  can it be done by passive mean  how should the measurement be presented  etc    in short  rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volume  ippm ha concentrated on transport  layer behaviour of the current  best  effort internet   rmonmib is beginning to consider application  layer measurement,0

research consortium pserc is trying to provide value to it member while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition  we are definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the member but rather working on more generic area that later individual member could see way to convert to proprietary tool  the work that shijie deng and rajnish kamat have been doing with me are good example  a to my trip  thanks for the invitation but i already committed myself to get back friday night so i will save my visit for another time  i will tell my son about the spring

   shmuel oren  on           pm   to   cc   dennis ray      subject  fw  pserc nugget related to market stem    hello vince  happy holiday   i wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of enron joining  pserc  a you might have heard from lance and alex we are going through a  transition period having doubled the number of university and industry  member within the last year  consequently  our business process are not  well developed  one of the problem we are facing is the balance between  the  electrical engineering folk and industry member that are more interested  in market related research  i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we  have more of a constituency in the advisory board that see the value of  market related research  i already have a verbal commitment from people at  electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc  with member like  electrabell and enron we will be able to support more market stem project  such a the one that shijie deng proposed  not funded in this round    please  let me know if i can do anything to facilitate the decision at enron  i am  going to be in austin on january  to participate at a puct hearing and  could come through huston for a visit  attached are some item that i  shared  with our pserc member and thought that you might be interested in them a  well   regard  shmuel         original message       from   shmuel oren   to   power system engineering research center   sent  tuesday  december       am  subject  re  pserc nugget related to market stem     the following are  item that demonstrate the impact of pserc research  in   the market stem area        on december   i  shmuel oren  testified at a hearing in san  francisco   before the blue ribbon panel  chaired by alfred kahn  for the that is   investigating the implication of uniform price v  pay a bid auction  in   the california px  a part of my testimony i presented a movie produced  by   tim mount and bob thomas that show result of an experimental economic  study   showing how bidder respond by raising their bid in a pay a bid  auction    following is an acknowledgement i received      dear shmuel        thank you for attending the blue ribbon panel this past tuesday in san   francisco  your presentation wa very informative and valuable to all  the   panel member and other participant  the panel greatly appreciates your   involvement in this important project        thanks again    natalie efland         a recent e  mail from the texas puc     professor oren  i hope you and your family are doing well  we are  seriously   considering your help and advice to facilitate the commission  s final   decision regarding retail competition in ercot      i wanted to let you know that ercot stakeholder filled an application  for   approval of the ercot protocol in november  we received comment  including   list of issue on november  and reply comment on december   staff  will   draft and submit a preliminary order to the commissioner for their   discussion on december   there will be a pre  hearing on december   when   party will be asked to brief the commission on list of issue by the  end   of first week in january  there will be a hearing on january  followed   with another hearing if needed  party have asked the commission to   finalize it decision by mid march      to give you some more background  i have to mention that almost most of  your   suggestion were accepted and will be reflected in the final protocol    except for problem with intra  zonal gaming regarding congestion  management   and pay  a  bid compensation for selected ancillary service  a few   additional concern are raised regarding ancillary service and  congestion   management  stakeholder are still working toward more load  participation   in ercot market  however  the main problem is the fact that market   pilot   that cover   of wholesale  but only   of retail load  will be open  on   june    based on a version of the protocol locked on august         that wa the deadline for ercot to give a final design to anderson   consulting   that version doe not include some of your recommendation  to   address market design flaw  the full version is highly possible to be   implemented by january    when market for   retail competition is   scheduled to open  given this gap  some party have recommended not to   implement incomplete protocol and wait for full implementation by  january     in other word  they say let  s go ahead with   pilot retail load    but wait for full design implementation before allowing   wholesale  load    and retail load  be subject to the rule of the game described in the  final   protocol      thanks      parviz adib  ph  d    director of market oversight division   public utility commission of texas    n  congress avenue   p  o  box    austin  texas      ph  no              the following is a segment from a published summary of the dec  puct   hearing  this segment describes the commision  s deliberation on an agenda   item addressing the possibility of instituting price cap a part of the   ercot protocol   see reference to my involvement in the next to last   paragraph      docket no    petition of the electric reliability council of  texas   for approval of the ercot protocol   discussion and possible action    parviz adib  jess totten  keith rogas  and tammy cooper   chairman wood turned to page  item number  of the draft order  identifying   issue  recommending that the word  including  be changed to  other than   in   the parenthesis  he think they know the ups and down of the two   mechanism  which are bid cap and price cap  but would not mind having   party focus on what other protection might be used  commissioner  walsh   would say  including  but not limited to  because she doe not think it  is  a   bad idea for ercot to at least consider in their protocol a fail  safe   mechanism  it  s kind of like the stock market suspending trading when   something crazy happens  they could consider a maximum scenario  such a    we don  t think this will ever happen but if it doe we need to muffle  it     whether it is     or   or whatever it is  they could consider  whether   to put into the protocol a self  enacting price cap  while not expecting  it   to happen  if it did  you don  t have to declare it an emergency and have  the   commission have to act  chairman wood asked if they could leave the   question without the parenthetical at all and just say  what protection   should be added to avoid extreme price spike   commissioner walsh   reiterated that she want ercot to think about the unlikely possibility  of   unacceptable price spike  she would like for them to have their own   fail  safe mechanism that is self  initiating a opposed to leaving that to   having someone have to come in and act  commissioner perlman stated that  he   think the california  type price cap is what the concern is about  he   think everyone in this state is opposed to those  but he think the  point   commissioner walsh is making is an interesting one  he had not thought   about the circuit breaker idea  and it might have some merit  he agreed   that it wa worth considering something like that  then the question   becomes what the level is  chairman wood suggested the wording  what   self  implementing protection should be added to avoid the price spike    commissioner perlman said he did not think anyone is talking about     price cap  commissioner walsh agreed  but noted that if the unexpected   happens we should be prepared  commissioner perlman indicated that if   someone is making     in one particular hour that it probably doe  not  b   enefit the market and is probably a windfall to them  it is not  something   they would normally put in their business plan for determining whether  they   are going to build a plant in texas  chairman wood stated that they want  to   lean toward the market a heavily a they can on these issue      chairman wood noted that some of these issue date back to when dr  oren  wa   assisting the commission  and asked if he could be brought back again    staffer dr  parviz adib said that staff had already talked to dr  oren  and   that he is available to assist the commission further  chairman wood  noted   that dr  oren had helped people think outside the box without just  focusing   on california      the final wording wa clarified to state  self  implementing mechanism   and   to delete the parenthetical part of the sentence in question  the order  wa   approved a amended                             ,0

subject  a  a math major vince  thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research group  after leaving your office  i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst  associate program that might be of interest to you  during a texas a  m recruiting meeting  i learned that we have expanded our list of major to include computer science  i wondered why math major were not mentioned  and wa told that there wa not a business need for math major  like liberal art major  they said math major were only considered on a person by person basis  in my opinion  math major have many of the same skill a finance major  and can easily adjust to accounting rotation a well  i did last summer  and finance major in the program are forced to every year   i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidate by limiting their recruitment effort  at texas a  m the career center asks company for a list of major they are targeting  and only allows those major to sign up for interview through the career center  i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the interview process on campus  however  many other math major had not heard of enron or the other company  and assumed that there wa no place for a math major at a company like enron  many math major want to continue their education  become teacher  or work for an actuarial firm  however  many are undecided  we are constantly told of the many business possibility available to math major by our teacher and staff  but many undergraduate are still not sure exactly what math major can contribute in a business environment  by not mentioning math major to the career center  a very simple and inexpensive step   enron is losing out on a very talented pool of people  while it would be nice to get the math major that knew about enron already  had thoroughly researched all company and determined that math major would fit perfectly  and went the extra step to send enron their resume outside the career center system  there are many qualified student who do not do this  and opt for other company who did mention math major  i called a manager in the a  a program to suggest that we consider at least mentioning math major to the career center  i realize that it may cost more to actively pursue them  talk to teacher  and attend math society event  however  i told her that including them at the career center would be very inexpensive for enron  she reiterated that they saw no business need for math major  and that if more upper level people began requesting them  it would be considered  i searched for  mathematics  on the enron job website  and had a surprising number of result  i know that your group could use math major a well  however  this still may be too small a number to merit a focus from the a  a recruiting department  i just wanted to bring it to your attention in case it wa something that you felt should be changed  thanks  heather johnson x ,0

subject  energy finance critique david  here are the review of the ut energy finance program that you requested  from jennifer martinez  mba class of   energy finance taken fall of    the energy finance program  year ago wa very good  especially considering it wa the first year of the program  there were a lot of guest speaker from various energy company who gave u a lot of practical knowledge about the energy industry through case study  lecture  etc  basically  we learned all the same finance concept and tool a in the regular finance class  but all the case and example were energy  related  the professor were good for the most part but didn  t have a great deal of practical industry experience  if i had to guess the reason for decreased participation in the program  i would probably say it is the professor  ronn and titman are great but known a being very technical and quantitative  some student prefer le technical professor and class that aren  t limiting to the energy industry  also  the fact that the class meet for  hour twice a week may not be so appealing  other than those thing  i can  t imagine why there ha been such a drop in enrollment  i especially don  t understand why every single person didn  t drop for enron  i wonder if it ha something to do with international status     from john massey  mba class of   energy finance taken fall of    bottom line  ut business school is great  investment fund  best activity available to student energy finance program  fairly weak  it wa a watered down version of the future option class crossed with a weak finance appendage  the finance teacher wa pathetic  both a poor teacher  ignorant about industry specific analysis  devoid of industry experience  rude to outside lecture  from industry  keith brown wa the only educator that wa any good and he only had a small portion of the class time  way to make better  get teacher with practical industry experience  make it a seminar class  focus on case study  lecture  given by people from industry  promote the class within the business school  i felt like ut did a poor job of internally  to student  promoting the class             from ross mesquita  mba class of   energy finance taken fall of    to be honest  a great majority of the coursework wa not energy specific  when energy application were presented  it seemed more like general finance question were reworded to include energy lingo  we had some very good speaker  but for the most part  i did not feel like the  hour of class had enough energy focus  i assumed that this would get better a the program progressed  one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energy finance is a very specific focus  i would have probably not enrolled in the energy finance program had it been available in my first year  i did not know enough about energy at that time and i had returned to b  school to consider several career option   i  e   investment banking  corporate finance  entrepreneurship  marketing  etc  a a new mba student  i would not want to narrow my window of opportunity to only energy company  here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mba   my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa            from billy braddock  mba class of   energy finance taken fall of    i wa a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of   the primary positive to the class revolved around outside panel  instruction  for example  enron sent representative on  separate occasion to discus particular topic  vince kaminski and gary hickerson   other notable speaker were jeff sandefer  independent business consultant and e  p professional   the beacon group  and encap investment  another good speaker wa a professor from ut  s school of engineering  he brought a good perspective a to the  basic  of the energy business  the class wa structured via a team  based instruction approach  with  professor team  teaching a   hour credit course  none of the  professor had any product knowledge of the energy business  of the  professor   were research focussed  tenured with little credibility in  teaching   one of the professor primary focus of research wa fixed income  while the other  were investment and corporate finance  respectively  a is the case for ut  s finance program in general  and energy finance in particular  ut is in dire need of teaching professor  a opposed to research professor  that have the ability to convey finance with practical example and at a level that can be more easily be understood by student without a finance background  particular to the energy program  ut need to have more instruction from energy professional  such a the instructor used for enron  s internal learning program  ie  derivative class  etc                           from bryan williams  mba class of   energy finance taken fall of    i participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall of   at the university of texas  the curriculum wa understandably   rough around the edge   a  wa the first year the energy finance course wa offered  however  the instruction also suffered a none of the instructor had any energy background to speak of  the   credit hour class wa team taught by three tenured professor   two of the three professor have co  authored textbook  and the third professor   s claim to fame is fixed income  a a group  the three professor are research  heavy  a opposed to industry focused   and the team  teaching format did not incent any one of the prof to be personably accountable for the success of the class  that said  the instructor did a good job attracting some top notch outside speaker  among them  vince kaminski  gary hickerson  both of enron  they also dedicated one class period to a video conference call with the beacon group  an energy consulting group that i believe wa recently acquired by goldman  jeff sandefer  an independent businessman  an entreprenuership instructor  and one of the foremost expert in the e  there are some experienced  brand  name professor  e  g  sheridan titman  teaching in the program  con   the program should give the student more exposure to energy company such a enron  specifically  it might need to help student link to the interview oppurtunites from these energy company such a enron  from george huan  mba class of   energy finance taken fall of    company expect mba student to have both general management  new idea  and analytic  quantative  skill  energy industry is no exception  energy finance program offer financial strategy and risk management course which fit in the insudtry need  however  these two course are far from enough to help student understand the dynemic of industrial transformation and excitement and opportunity in this industry  other management and quantitive course are needed to complete this program  my suggestion    seminar or lecture about energy industry and energy company  before student make their decision  let them know  what  s happening and what  s going to happen in this industry  what the company are doing now  who they are looking for    management and  or analytical course should be included  such a  strategy  financial enginering and real option    more industry connection  presentation and discussion                                  from charlie weldon  mba class of   energy finance taken in fall of   my experience in the energy finance program overall wa a positive experience  the most rewarding part of the class wa the guest speaker brought in during dr  titman  s portion of the class  this part of the course is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of   case class all focusing on the energy industry  two of the case were based on enron  and overall the case selection in my opinion wa very appropriate and well thought out  value added by the professor wa le than from the speaker and case  the first eight week of the course covered future and option  nearly all of the example and problem discussed pertained directly to the energy industry and special emphasis wa placed on increasing the student  s understanding of the supply and demand dynamic in the power market  the use of option and future for speculating and  or hedging wa stressed on numerous occasion and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power plant project  i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying to continuously make improvement to the program  however  i do not believe that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to improvement  there is a strong need for more practical based training on energy derivative similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron  the focus of the university teacher is quite theoretical  due in large part to their background  while the theoretical basis is crucial to understanding the basic  the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course  until measure are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive industry experience  i believe the energy finance program will continue to underdeliver on it objective  additionally  i believe that the course structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having  consecutive hour of classroom instruction ,0
subject  california update      the following report contains confidential and sensitive information  please treat with discretion  executive summary   ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objective  politically  bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis  from an economic perspective  he is unwilling to create disincentive for new power generation  davis find four major flaw with ferc plan  most notably it exclusion of out  of  state generator  june lst  kill clause  for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan  california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade  expected   billion power bill this summer   economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement  qf bid for advance payment from pg  e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  new generation delay probable because of state  qf squabbling  consumer group are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal   ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that look like action  but is not  rather  it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated  the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis can not escape shouldering the blame  once they are politically inoculated  the administration can begin to look at regional solution  moreover  the administration ha already made explicit  and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report  it opposition to stronger price cap on the ground that they are unwilling to create disincentive to the construction of new generation  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generator were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favor price cap actually voted against this plan    something le than effective price cap from davis  s point of view  the ferc plan ha four major flaw   the order applies only to california  not to the rest of the west  non  california generator are not required to sell at capped rate to california   a the order is written  it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling   state official also believe that energy supplier will continue to game the system  because the price mitigation scheme only kick in after a stage  emergency and doe not require any collusion   even when the price cap kick in  they are based on the cost  plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesaler to abide by the cap  the generator can also charge above the cap  provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc    proposal  kill clause  add to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a  kill clause  that say the cap will be withdrawn unless california  s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control  if davis doesn  t sign on to the regional grid by june lst  then he will have to live with june  nd headline blaming him for letting the  bush price cap plan  collapse    growing fiscal risk in california source speculate that california could therefore pay a much a   billion on power this summer  this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg  e and sce  these source believe that  because of the severity of the situation  the ferc and  or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control price for power  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about  day  one of the first project to be cancelled will be state plan to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long  term power deal  the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditor to revisit the bridge loan they are providing to california  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture  the country  s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surplus to serious debt downgrade and devastating deficit in a matter of month    qfs to seek advance payment from pg  e meanwhile  on the bankruptcy front  the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge  s account  since their natural gas vendor have likewise demanded advance payment for gas  it appears very unlikely that the qfs  request will be granted  if the qfs do not receive advance payment  it is likely that most of the    mw of gas  fired qf capacity will remain offline   delay likely in new qf generation the qf deal made with the state for long  term contract are being continually renegotiated  which is likely to mean that the new plant those contract are supposed to finance will not be online a early a anticipated    consumer group ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleague reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan  the analysis wa done by a utility analyst  rather than a lawyer  though it appears to raise a number of good legal point  for example  one of the element of the mou is a  non  bypassable  charge on ratepayer that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid  this is effectively a tax  since there is no exchange of value for money  which under the ca constitution can not be used to directly benefit a private entity  this make the bond that would be issued are general obligation bond  rather than revenue bond  according to the constitution  the state can not be put into debt to benefit a private company  for this and other reason  even if the republican would vote for the sce bailout  which remains unlikely  the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge    governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long  term power contract the issue of the governor  s failure to disclose the detail of the long  term power contract continues to distress the other player in the crisis  even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating  it is likely that their action and negotiation will challenged  creating an even further delay ,0

to california the responsibility for addressing state  related matter  a discussed below  at the same time  ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issue a well a the imposition of region  wide price cap  ferc reiterated the november  conclusion that under certain circumstance  california ratepayer were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rate due to california  s  seriously flawed  market structure and rule in conjunction with tight demand and supply condition throughout the west  while all four commissioner supported the order a a consensus  based outcome that appropriately balanced all competing interest  each commissioner expressed reservation with particular aspect of the order  chairman hoecker and comm  breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement  while comms  hebert and massey laid out their position where they believed the commission had either  over  reached  or not gone far enough  just a they did on november   a discussed below  highlight of key action     ferc adopted the november  proposal to eliminate  effective immediately  the state  s mandatory requirement that the state  s investor  owned utility buy and sell electricity through the px  and allow these utility to purchase electricity through forward contract and other alternative mechanism to manage supply risk  ferc terminated the px  s rate schedule effective at the close of business on april     in effect  a chairman hoecker stated  the order de  federalizes  percent of the california wholesale market established under the state  s restructuring law  returning ratemaking authority over company  owned generation to the california public utility commission  cpuc      ferc modified the effective period of the november     mwh  soft cap  proposal  limiting it application through april   whereupon a  comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate threshold  screen and mitigation measure  must be in place  in a

the refund condition to clarify that while certain refund condition will continue to apply  unless ferc issue written notification to the seller that it transaction is still under review  refund

contract  this benchmark will be used in assessing any complaint regarding justness and reasonableness of pricing long  term contract  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contract at reasonable rate  ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market participant     ferc adopted the november  proposal to require market participant to schedule  percent of their transaction in the day  ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under  scheduling  in excess of five percent of hourly load requirement   in order to discourage over  reliance on the real  time spot market     ferc directed the iso and the three investor  owned utility to file generation interconnection standard     ferc affirmed the longer  term measure proposed in the november  order  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april        ferc deferred resolving key issue  including establishing new iso board selection procedure  developing appropriate market monitoring measure and negotiating protective order associated with data collection     ferc reiterated it november  call to california policy maker there to resolve state issue  such a     immediately implementing the availability of day ahead market for power purchase     development of demand response     siting of generation and transmission  and    assurance of sufficient reserve requirement  commissioner response comm  hebert reluctantly concurred  calling the final order a  missed opportunity  to  among other thing  send appropriate signal for new generation siting and conservation  reiterating his november  concern  hebert recounted the remedial remedy that he maintained the commission should and should not have adopted  while expressing pleasure at the tone of the order   balanced and considerate    the bid certainly reversal  and the role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board  hebert nonetheless objected to the benchmark price established in the order  which he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low  hebert faulted the commission for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november  order approving the ca iso  s emergency    mwh  soft cap  proposal  hebert ended by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utility there to forward contract  including easing the existing prudence review requirement  comm  breathitt endorsed the order  reiterating her support for progress towards open and competitive market  she noted that the order properly  walked the line  by taking all of the competing interest into account  calling it le than ideal  but a step in the right direction  she also concentrated her remark on the importance of creating stability which will be accomplished by encouraging long term contract and the implementation of the    mwh breakpoint  additionally she mentioned that any price below the    mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable  comm  massey concurred  but prefaced his remark by expressing sympathy for california ratepayer  stating that he felt that market power had been exercised  that price were not just and reasonable and that the marketer had profited too much at the expense of others in the market  he warned that  a he understood the legal precedent  the federal court were poised to grant cost recovery relief to the retailer which would then be passed on to consumer  on the positive side  he approved of the de  federalization of   of the market and the creation of long term contract  however  he emphasized that california regulator must now take the responsibility of creating more generation and transmission  in the long term  comm  massey hoped that solution could be reached starting with a technical conference and that the market would have rule more like pjm  finally  comm  massey articulated what he would have liked to have done differently  he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the on  going investigation  he also disagreed with the    mwh breakpoint  preferring instead a hard price per generator  the commissioner said he would have set the long term benchmark for only two year instead of five and that he would have opened a section  investigation in the west  finally  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refund  chairman hoecker began his comment by saying that the commission wa forced to act and act quickly because the stake are so high  he feel that it is now time for the state regulator and market to act  he noted that by shrinking the cal px  the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the long term contract and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the least amount of damage to the utility  in regard to suggestion for a regional price cap  the chairman stated that this would not work due to the fact that the commission ha no jurisdiction over bonneville  wapa and the public power producer and that there is no spot market in the northwest  however  he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to address regional issue  finally  in conceptually addressing the california situation  the chairman stated that competition or  deregulation  did not fail in california  but that there never wa competition in california ,0

make an informed choice a to the model which best suit their need   in order to meet our objective the book is divided into  chapter   in chapter  we give an overview of the fundamental principal needed to model and price energy derivative which will underpin the remainder of the book   in addition to introducing the technique that underlie the black  scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical technique of trinomial tree and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing  which are used throughout the book   in chapter  we discus the analysis of spot energy price   a well a analysing empirical price movement we propose a number of process that can be used to model the price   we look at the well  know process of geometric brownian motion a well a mean reversion  stochastic volatility and jump process  discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameter estimated   chapter   written by vince kaminski  grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp   discus volatility estimation in energy commodity market   this chapter build on the previous one   it examines in detail the method  merit and pitfall of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing model introduced in chapter    example from crude  gas  and electricity market are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspect of calculating volatility   chapter  examines forward curve in the energy market   although such curve are well understood and straight  forward in the most financial market  the difficulty of storage in many energy market lead to le well defined curve   in this chapter we describe forward price bound for energy price and the building of forward curve from market instrument   we outline the three main approach which have been applied to building forward curve in energy market  the arbitrage approach  the econometric approach  and deriving analytical value by modelling underlying stochastic factor   chapter  present an overview of structure found in the energy derivative market and discus their us   example of product analysed in this chapter include a variety of swap  cap  floor and collar  a well a energy swaptions  compound option  asian option  barrier option  lookback option  and ladder option   chapter  investigates single and multi  factor model of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivative   closed form solution for forward price  forward volatility  and european option price both on the spot and forward are derived and presented for all the model in this chapter including a three factor  stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model   chapter  show how the price of path dependent and american style option can be evaluated for the model in chapter    simulation scheme are developed for the evaluation of european style option and applied to a variety of path dependent option   in order to price option which incorporate early exercise opportunity  a trinomial tree scheme is developed   this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic a well a standard european and american style option   chapter  describes a methodology for valuing energy option based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve   the approach result in a multi  factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curve   the user defined volatility structure can be of an extremely general form   closed  form solution are developed for pricing standard european option  and efficient monte carlo scheme are presented for pricing exotic option   the chapter close with a discussion of the valuation of american style option   chapter  focus on the risk management of energy derivative position   in this chapter we discus the management of price risk for institution that trade option or other derivative and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time   we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivative and look at extension to gamma hedging   illustrating the technique using both spot and forward curve model   the general model presented in chapter  is ideally suited to multi  factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivative and this is also discussed   chapter  examines the key risk management concept of value at risk  var  applied to portfolio containing energy derivative product   after discussing the concept of the measure  we look at how the key input  volatility  covariance  correlation  etc  can be estimated   we then compare the four major methodology for computing var  delta  delta  gamma  historical simulation and monte  carlo simulation  applying each to the same portfolio of energy option   in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimate for various underlying energy market variable   finally  in chapter  we review modelling approach to credit risk   we look in detail at two quite different approach  creditmetrics  j  p  morgan     and creditrisk   credit suisse financial product     for which detailed information is publicly available   together these provide an extensive set of tool with which to measure credit risk   we present numerical example of applying these technique to energy derivative   before we begin we stress that the model and method we present in this book are tool which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the   tool   and the market work   the technique we describe are certainly not   magic wand   which can be waved at data and risk management problem to provide instant and perfect solution   to quote from the riskmetrics technical document     no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk      however  the right tool  correctly used make the job a lot easier ,0

subject  precious metal var jason  after our brief discussion last night i think i should discus a few of the issue i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are proposing  the var model  a i illustrated  is set up to accept a term structure of delta position  price and vols and it may be difficult to translate the  silver mine  position into these input  i do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and then make some assumption about vol and price  the var model also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a  day holding period  to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced a these sensitivity are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict  if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help to prioritise my time  i will also need to consult with vince kaminski and tanya tamarachenko in houston for advice  rac will also assist in the process  please contact me if you have any further question  kirstee x ,0

subject  enron europe organisational change once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed  expected in q  of this year  eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on co  managing enron  s lng market  we are very appreciative of eric  s effort in europe since early  and look forward to continuing to work very closely with his lng team in the coming year  from this point forward eric will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing arcos  we are therefore making the following change immediately  the origination responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw  ricardo bortolloti will continue in the role a italian country manager and will report to eric shaw  mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman  the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility for our natural gas risk position in spain  this position is much more likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas market and paul will work quite closely with both enron global market and the continental gas team  ross sankey who ha been managing our marketing effort in holland will also head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power transmission opportunity across europe  among the prospect his team will pursue include project from norway to the uk  sweden to the continent  and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity  he will report to eric shaw for the holland market and to richard lewis for the transmission responsibility  finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team than our power team on the continent  therefore david galagher who manages our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis  we have aggressive income target for this year and anticipate that these change will create the right link to optimize our performance  please help make these change a smooth a possible  john sherriff michael brown,0

all independent power producer were allowed to sell power to whoever wa willing to pay for it  that  unfortunately  is not allowed by law  which force private sector generator to sell power only to state utility  which in turn  are not permitted to sell power across state on their own  most state electricity board are bankrupt  mseb reportedly owes central utility r    crore  they can not bring themselves to charge many type of user for the power consumed  nor can they prevent large  scale theft of electricity  few  including wealthy maharashtra  have the will to reform state electricity board and privatise transmission and distribution  given this profile of buyer  private generator demand sovereign guarantee to help them tide over default risk  but the guarantee merely insulate ipps against risk  they can not make seb solvent  yet  india need power desperately  maharashtra  india   s richest state  experience power shortage of around    mw  about a sixth of it peak need  over time  the hunger for power will only grow  india can not afford to wait for the painful politics of seb reform to work themselves out  the government should bring in legislation that allows ipps to sell power directly to paying customer  this will free ipps from the clutch of bankrupt monopsony buyer  the power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequence for the government too  once ipps are freed from their onerous obligation to sell power to single  mostly bankrupt buyer  their default risk will come down substantially  new delhi and state government should then scrap the guarantee that they gave ipps in the past  the combination of power trading  private investment in generation  transmission and distribution  and gradual seb reform will create a commercial  workable

pay nearly    per cent sale tax on naphtha that wa procured from gujarat  however  following their representation  the government slashed the sale tax rate to  per cent  the state finance department  s opinion  which would be presented before the state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision  deserves special significance especially when the state energy department and the loss  making maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  have wholeheartedly supported the dpc  s cause and recommended the sale tax waiver  dpc  which wa asked by the union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in view of excess availability  in it presentation to the state government and to mseb  had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to pas on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on to it consumer  dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid sale tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year   source from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sale tax exemption to dpc because the ioc  at the behest of the centre  ha tried to match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed memorandum of agreement with dpc   if the state finance department stick to it view  it may hurt the state a a whole   source from the state energy department and mseb said  dpc will procure naphtha at r    per ton from ioc during the calender year  a compared to the r    per tonne price quoted by glencore  the naphtha price comprises   per tonne free on board  fob      per cent of custom duty     per cent of sale tax and     of premium  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company ha already made an appeal to the state government for the sale tax waiver on naphtha in the larger interest of the consumer   sale tax is a pas through and mseb  which will have to bear the additional burden  will pas it on the consumer   he added         centre yet to receive proposal on enron thursday jan   centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power  asked about the report that maharashtra government wa sending a proposal that centre buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading corporation  power minister suresh prabhu said  we have not received any proposal    we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete proposal before intervening in this matter   parbhu said on the sideline of greentech environment excellence award ceremony  here  asked whether there wa any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to buy power from the dhabol power corporation  prabhu replied  what will the ptc do with the power   prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before approaching the centre for payment of due  mseb had earlier declined to pick up it  per cent stake in phase ii of the  mw project  the enron issue ha been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to clear the due of dpc a a result of the skyrocketing price of naphtha infact mseb ha asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where dpc ha stopped production at the facility from the begining of the month  state government ha stepped in with support to the tune of r  crore to enable mseb to clear the due for october  mseb due to dpc for november and december amount to over r  crore ,0

subject  re  equity investment fair value in turkey john  it seems to me that using a risk  free rate is not appropriate  i shall elaborate on my position and send you a longer message this afternoon  my time   vince enron capital  trade resource corp   europe from  john bottomley         am to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect cc  john sherriff  lon  ect  ect  dale surbey  lon  ect  ect subject  equity investment fair value in turkey vince  john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting  and potentially contentious  option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in london  we hold longish term option in a private company in turkey which is currently seeking to ipo  the issue we are discussing with rac is which discount rate  i  e   risk  free  and if so turkish or u   should we use to value these option first  some additional information  option characteristic       option  representing   of the company    term  minimum of  year but possibly longer   still being renegotiated   strike price    below the upcoming ipo price  either priced in u  or turkish lira  we currently hold the above number of option with a fixed price of     per option but    expire on july    with the remainder expiring on december     the company  s investment banker  abn  amro rothchilds  are concerned regarding the strike price because it value the company at   million and they believe the company is worth approx   million  due to such a large  valuation gap   they originally encouraged u to exercise all of the option by the end of june  ipo target date in late sept  early oct   our counter  proposal is to  swap  instrinsic value for time value by repricing the option strike higher while extending their term  we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the option  we are arguing that the u risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company  s historical senior debt cost     is the more appropriate number to use  although admit that this is not justifiable   only a proxy  a few key point    rac is valuing the option via crystal ball simulation such that this  to be negotiated  discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future option intrinsic value in  year  i  e   for black  scholes  a higher discount rate yield a higher value but the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation    the model simulates both an ipo  no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we have put option for our equity priced at a fixed   return   the model assigns a   illiquidity discount   in the simulated case where the option are out  of  the  money  we obviously do not exercise  we understand that for black  scholes option valuation  one need to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flow using equity future and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold  and here is where we reach our difficulty  since the company doesn  t currently trade on a public market and since equity future do not exist for turkish equity  rac is arguing that a u risk free is not appropriate to use  our argument is that the non  ipo scenario  a   illiquidity discount and a u  based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation  a such  we feel rac  s approach is double counting  if you managed to get through the above  your a patient man  i  ll give you a call today or tomorrow after you  ve had a chance to digest the information  regard  john bottomley,0

possibility of enron joining pserc  a you might have heard from lance and alex we are going through a transition period having doubled the number of university and industry member within the last year  consequently  our business process are not well developed  one of the problem we are facing is the balance between the electrical engineering folk and industry member that are more interested in market related research  i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we have more of a constituency in the advisory board that see the value of market related research  i already have a verbal commitment from people at electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc  with member like electrabell and enron we will be able to support more market stem project such a the one that shijie deng proposed  not funded in this round   please let me know if i can do anything to facilitate the decision at enron  i am going to be in austin on january  to participate at a puct hearing and could come through huston for a visit  attached are some item that i shared with our pserc member and thought that you might be interested in them a well  regard  shmuel       original message      from

the implication of uniform price v  pay a bid auction in  the california px  a part of my testimony i presented a movie produced by  tim mount and bob thomas that show result of an experimental economic study  showing how bidder respond by raising their bid in a pay a bid auction   following is an acknowledgement i received    dear shmuel     thank you for attending the blue ribbon panel this past tuesday in san  francisco  your presentation wa very informative and valuable to all the  panel member and other participant  the panel greatly appreciates your  involvement in this important project     thanks again   natalie efland      a recent e  mail from the texas puc   professor oren  i hope you and your family are doing well  we are seriously  considering your help and advice to facilitate the commission  s final  decision regarding retail competition in ercot    i wanted to let you know that ercot stakeholder filled an application for  approval of the ercot protocol in november  we received comment including  list of issue on november  and reply comment on december   staff will  draft and submit a preliminary order to the commissioner for their  discussion on december   there will be a pre  hearing on december  when  party will be asked to brief the commission on list of issue by the end  of first week in january  there will be a hearing on january  followed  with another hearing if needed  party have asked the commission to  finalize it decision by mid march    to give you some more background  i have to mention that almost most of your  suggestion were accepted and will be reflected in the final protocol   except for problem with intra  zonal gaming regarding congestion management  and pay  a  bid compensation for selected ancillary service  a few  additional concern are raised regarding ancillary service and congestion  management  stakeholder are still working toward more load participation  in ercot market  however  the main problem is the fact that market  pilot  that cover   of wholesale  but only   of retail load  will be open on  june    based on a version of the protocol locked on august       that wa the deadline for ercot to give a final design to anderson  consulting   that version doe not include some of your recommendation to  address market design flaw  the full version is highly possible to be  implemented by january    when market for   retail competition is  scheduled to open  given this gap  some party have recommended not to  implement incomplete protocol and wait for full implementation by january    in other word  they say let  s go ahead with   pilot retail load   but wait for full design implementation before allowing   wholesale load   and retail load  be subject to the rule of the game described in the final  protocol    thanks    parviz adib  ph  d   director of market oversight division  public utility commission of texas   n  congress avenue  p  o  box   austin  texas     ph  no            the following is a segment from a published summary of the dec  puct  hearing  this segment describes the commision  s deliberation on an agenda  item addressing the possibility of instituting price cap a part of the  ercot protocol   see reference to my involvement in the next to last  paragraph    docket no    petition of the electric reliability council of texas  for approval of the ercot protocol   discussion and possible action   parviz adib  jess totten  keith rogas  and tammy cooper  chairman wood turned to page  item number  of the draft order identifying  issue  recommending that the word  including  be changed to  other than  in  the parenthesis  he think they know the ups and down of the two  mechanism  which are bid cap and price cap  but would not mind having  party focus on what other protection might be used  commissioner walsh  would say  including  but not limited to  because she doe not think it is a  bad idea for ercot to at least consider in their protocol a fail  safe  mechanism  it  s kind of like the stock market suspending trading when  something crazy happens  they could consider a maximum scenario  such a   we don  t think this will ever happen but if it doe we need to muffle it    whether it is     or   or whatever it is  they could consider whether  to put into the protocol a self  enacting price cap  while not expecting it  to happen  if it did  you don  t have to declare it an emergency and have the  commission have to act  chairman wood asked if they could leave the  question without the parenthetical at all and just say  what protection  should be added to avoid extreme price spike   commissioner walsh  reiterated that she want ercot to think about the unlikely possibility of  unacceptable price spike  she would like for them to have their own  fail  safe mechanism that is self  initiating a opposed to leaving that to  having someone have to come in and act  commissioner perlman stated that he  think the california  type price cap is what the concern is about  he  think everyone in this state is opposed to those  but he think the point  commissioner walsh is making is an interesting one  he had not thought  about the circuit breaker idea  and it might have some merit  he agreed  that it wa worth considering something like that  then the question  becomes what the level is  chairman wood suggested the wording  what  self  implementing protection should be added to avoid the price spike   commissioner perlman said he did not think anyone is talking about    price cap  commissioner walsh agreed  but noted that if the unexpected  happens we should be prepared  commissioner perlman indicated that if  someone is making     in one particular hour that it probably doe not b  enefit the market and is probably a windfall to them  it is not something  they would normally put in their business plan for determining whether they  are going to build a plant in texas  chairman wood stated that they want to  lean toward the market a heavily a they can on these issue    chairman wood noted that some of these issue date back to when dr  oren wa  assisting the commission  and asked if he could be brought back again   staffer dr  parviz adib said that staff had already talked to dr  oren and  that he is available to assist the commission further  chairman wood noted  that dr

re  trip to houston stinson  thank you for your e  mail  my phone number is        i graduated from princeton university in   mathematics   and came straight to mit for a ph  d  in operation management at the sloan schoolof management  in my first three year i took all the required coursework in mathematics  optimization  stochastic process  etc   a well a a number of course in psychology  at mit and harvard   i am working with prof  gabriel bitran  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operation  in particular  i am interested in the interaction between customer and company  hence the interest in psychology   the  tentative  title of my phd thesis is  pricing substitute product on the internet   and i am sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few week ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about  thanks again  and i  m looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week  paulo pricing substitute product on the internet objective  to develop new tool to decide pricing policy for good and service sold on the internet  motivation  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization model are not appropriate for internet  related business  the technological innovation associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affect the way in which consumer make choice  furthermore  company have a great deal of influence on how much information consumer can have access to  the problem of pricing substitute product is an important strategic issue faced by internet company  consumer usually search for generic product  e  g  vcr or computer  without knowing exactly what they will buy  company can show different product and different price to each consumer  this type of flexibility wa not available until the internet came about  the problem of pricing substitute product is not unique to the internet  the methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other setting  such a pricing service  service are unique  and there are many case where customer will only buy one of many service offered by a given company  our model will help company decide which service to offer to which customer and how much to charge for these service  research strategy  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two component which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategy  these component are choice model and optimization model  choice model  choice model describe how customer make choice  the management literature draw on two main source for these model  psychology and economics  the common approach in psychology model is to use what are called heuristic elimination method  these method consist of the elimination of option based on the sequential elimination of feature until only one choice remains  these method tend to be very context  specific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis  economist focus on utility  maximing model that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological model  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model  the problem with these type of model is that they are not very accurate reflection of how consumer make choice on the internet  the first step in our research will be to develop choice model that capture the interaction going on between customer and company on the internet  optimization  traditionally  the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon  on the internet  the problem of maximizing revenue still exists  but there is also a need to learn about customer  short term profit is based on sale  but long term profit is based on how well you know your customer and are able to retain them  the optimization problem must therefore include a short term component  sale  and a long term component  learning  ,0
subject  energy leader consulting generation evaluator  ege  shirley  a requested  herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski  the presentation on the ege tool  s application and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour  if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday  may   might i request it be set for late afternoon  a my other appointment are the next day   and  a vince will recall  i wa co  leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly  and developer of the ramp up  real time   check and electric strategy tool  presently  i am ceo of energy leader consulting  elc   background the u  s  power generation industry ha become increasingly efficient in recent year  rapidly growing new entrant seek profit maximization aggressively  utility  who still control most power plant  endeavor to adopt the entrant  method  yet  inefficiency among many utility remains widespread  utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decade  old habit and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling  many utility  notwithstanding the industry  wide trend towards profit maximization  cling to ingrained routine  inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale  a utility may operate a relatively small system  fewer than a dozen plant   a small system lack portfolio diversification and perspective in it focus on it regulated customer  playing the wholesale market at the margin  for a variety of reason  utility are reluctant to cut back the start of their generating unit  let alone shut down any  even temporarily or seasonally   economically inefficient unit continue to be committed  week after week  and run in the half  load range  ege objective ege identifies and ass generating unit of a utility with questionable commitment routine  taking into account transmission and reliability factor  the procedure point towards profit opportunity that may be exploited by another industry participant  i  an industry participant can use ege a a basis for a medium or long  term wholesale power transaction with a utility  or to price wholesale power more aggressively  to take market share from the utility  i  e   compel change in unit commitment habit   ii  an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiency that would come from a merger or acquisition  iii  a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility  s unit commitment routine inevitably become rationalized  specific ege concept ege reduces and analysis the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunity  it produce indicative statistic such a  a  the frequency distribution of start per week  b  the frequency distribution of start by day    minute segment during the week  c  the frequency distribution of load level  d  the frequency distribution of hour of operation per start  e  average heat rate and approximate fully  allocated cost in the half  load range  f  average ramp rate from the half  load range  g  the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hour  and h  forced  off maintenance outage rate  where indicated   indicative statistic are generally aggregated by month  year  in some case  by temperature range   they can be by regional wholesale price a well   ege establishes if the target utility ha changed unit commitment routine significantly in recent year  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data  ege is now updated for the  th quarter   through december      ege lst quarter   through march     will be available approximately june     ege also compare and rank generating unit  commitment and dispatch with that of similar unit operated by the target utility  a well a other regional generator   some utility operate a group of economically marginal unit at the half  load level for lengthy time period  without an apparent reliability basis   splitting the limited economic demand for power among the unit  other ege supporting data  i  planned maintenance schedule  where indicated   j  actual maximum generating capacity  k  actual minimum generating capacity  actual maximum and minimum can differ significantly from government  reported value   l  average heat rate in the full  load range  and m  average heat rate in the three  quarter  load range  with respect to a generating unit  average heat rate in the half  load  three  quarter  load and full  load range  it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating unit within a region  it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variation in average heat rate and maximum capacity  and change in recent year in these parameter  the real  world example of allegheny energy allegheny energy can serve a a case study to illustrate the application of ege  in the  th quarter   for instance  one high  cost generating unit wa started virtually every weekday morning   time  and committed for the whole day  in all but two case   arguably  there are power product that could substitute for this routine  in part at least  at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy  another high  cost allegheny energy generating unit wa started virtually every weekend during the autumn  nine time  and committed for most of the coming week  at another plant  two high  cost unit were operated too often in the expensive half  load range  some  hour  and three  quarter  load range  another  to  hour   they were seldom called upon to run at higher level  again  there are power product that that address these practice and might appeal to allegheny energy  offering of energy leader consulting  elc  ege is a procedure  not a software package or data base  elc belief this format is more effective in arming client with the information they need to act upon profit opportunity  elc transfer it  knowledge  about the ege procedure and the supporting data method in a straight  forward four  step process    enron would select one to three target utility    elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utility    employing this real  world analysis a a pedagogic tool  elc  in a one  day seminar with enron personnel  would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future  without the assistance of elc     optionally  elc would provide ege supporting data  quarterly  to enron  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating unit under the continuous emission monitoring program  virtually all fossil fuel unit   parameter that are incorporated  and the data set format  will be specified upon request  custom modification will be considered  steven a  mitnick chief executive officer energy leader consulting   st street  nw washington  dc        voice       fax smitnick  energyleader

it took a day for my new grandson to warm up to me  the first day they stared at me  perhaps wondering what they were supposed to do with this man  who they were told is  grandpa   i waited patiently  i knew boy like to play  they  d come to me in their own time  on day two  the oldest two were doing summersault over my lap  the youngest  ben  took a little longer  but yesterday he raced me across the yard thirty time and won every time  the weekend brought back memory of my own childhood  we had such imagination  in our mind  a tree wa a tower to spot approaching bad guy  a big rock became a mountain  a fallen log a space ship headed to the star  we had toy  but we had to use our imagination  not like the new toy i see my grandkids with  our toy didn  t talk  and if they did  you pulled a string to make it work  we had block to build  crayon to create  truck and car to push  they were simple toy that required imagination  i thought about the toy in my garage  the one i saved  when my child outgrew them  they were simple and needed their imagination to work  mr  potato head allowed them to learn part of the body and giggle at the funny face with an ear where it mouth should have been  i still have an old plastic phone  it ha a dial to turn  a bell that ring when you push a button  and that  s it  it doesn  t talk  squawk  beep or move around the room  it  s simple and wa used

wouldn  t it be better to be playing yourself  if we don  t like the sport available to watch  we create new one  it doesn  t matter what  people will pay to see it  because they need to be entertained  i haven  t heard of world championship worm digging  but if someone offered a large cash price  people would buy ticket to scream at the contestant  i worry  are we becoming a society

subject  re  stressing correlation hi  everybody  following up on our discussion on stressing correlation i made a spreadsheet and a dll  here is what it doe  in the input   main  sheet  the user ha to specify   the size of the correlation matrix   the row and column for the element he want to stress  row   and col   in the example   the integer number n _ iter   the original correlation matrix  in the output  see sheet  result   we see  column   the first column contains possible correlation value  from   to   n _ iter   number  for the element        the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the  stressed  correlation matrix  which is the same a the original matrix except the element      and      which take value from   to    thus  the user can see which value for the chosen element      are permitted  those for which the smallest eigenvalue is positive  marked green in the example   the user might decide that he want to assign the correlation which is  not permitted  to this particular element  the smallest eigenvalue is negative   then the user might have a few option    all the element of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the chosen element ha the desired correlation in it  but the change in the correlation matrix is the  smallest  possible  in the sense of matrix norm   this is my next step to do for this spreadsheet     just one column  and the corresponding row  of course  will change  while the rest of the matrix will stay unchanged  kevin  s suggestion   in this case the user have to choose which column  and row  he prefers to modify  in my example  column  row  or column  row    we can discus this approach with risk control and see how they like it  i send you only the spreadsheet with an example now  tanya ,0

subject  proj  x analytics diligence paul  vince and i spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the trading analytics  there is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a two day time period  i think a reasonable start would be the following    obtain an audited history of the trading strategy which have been implemented in order to verify profitability  and p  l volatility of each    review needed working capital and risk capital requirement and compare these to projection for trading income    review current level of access to electronic market and verify that a change of ownership would not have adverse consequence  i  e  are there guarantee of continued access using the current system    review feasibility of entry into proposed new market  it is far from clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity market given the current limited  electronic  liquidity    review  at least qualitatively  the current trading strategy being used  try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these strategy will disappear a other  s implement similar trading model  what is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage    review the methodology used to generate new trading strategy which will be needed to replace the current model a they become unprofitable and outdated    try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading technology to enron  s other market  given the illiquidity of these market a compared to the financial equity market  if there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis  we would probably want to run their system on a test set of data  let me know if you have other suggestion    stinson,0
