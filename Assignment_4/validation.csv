subject  re  choosing the riskfree rate dear all  i completeley agree with ben that treasury are the most liquid and reliable benchmark  i also think that fmas have their own advantage and disadvantage  however  it look like it would be very difficult for u to avoid using libor a benchmark  at least to price anything related to capital market  for example  credit default swap   our price will always be different from that on capital market if we use benchmark different from the market  a a half  way solution we can have different benchmark  for example  use anything  that we decide is closest to risk  free  to value product significantly different from that priced on capital market  and libor for everything priced on capital market  we can adjust by manipulating other coefficient  event  liquidity  recovery  for our purpose  but it look like benchmark should be libor  to avoid negative default probabilites  for highly rated reference entity  we can add cost fo repo and haircut  a all banker do   let u continue our discussion on this  slava benjamin parson         to  bryan seyfried  lon  ect  ect  martin mcdermott  lon  ect  ect  viacheslav danilov  lon  ect  ect  stuart ffoulkes  lon  ect  ect  eklavya sareen  lon  ect  ect  tomas valnek  lon  ect  ect  john metzler  lon  ect  ect  simon brook  lon  ect  ect  konstantin malinovski  lon  ect  ect cc  vasant shanbhogue  hou  ect  ect  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  steven leppard  lon  ect  ect  jitendra patel  lon  ect  ect  william s bradford  hou  ect  ect  harry arora  hou  ect  ect subject  choosing the riskfree rate dear all  following on from the discussion had with vince et al a few week ago  regarding the problem inherent in using treasury a our benchmark riskfree curve  i  ve written the attached short document  my preliminary conclusion are a follows  recent turmoil in the treasury market mostly hit  and   year bond  treasury are still the most liquid curve  and that used by bank for benchmarking risky debt  there is a considerable a liquidity  scarcity premium inherent within the corporate  treasury spread  which we are not taking into account  more accurate measurement of this premium should allow u to calculate bankruptcy price based on treasury  which are consistent with the market  all further comment are welcome of course  regard ben,0

solution  toshiba is uniting digital  mobile and network innovation in a bold new vision of information technology for today and tomorrow  take a closer look at life in the new digital age  and imagine how good it can be  visit toshiba  com for more detail  the real wolf reckoning by paul krugman ecently i received a letter from an economist i respect  chiding me for my  naderite  column on the california energy crisis  he just didn  t believe that market manipulation by power company could possibly be an important issue  it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee  jerk leftist  who blame greedy capitalist for every problem  be it third  world poverty or high apartment rent  the left ha cried  wolf   so many time that sensible people have learned to discount such claim  but now a bona fide wolf ha arrived  whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state   and nobody will believe it  true  california would be heading for a summer of power shortage even if it had never deregulated  and even if there wa workable competition in the wholesale electricity market  price in that market would spike during period of peak demand  transferring billion of dollar from either taxpayer or consumer to the generator  but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn  t workable competition in california  s power market  and that the action of generator  gaming the system  have greatly magnified the crisis  the key fact is that california ha somehow remained in a state of more or le continuous power shortage and very high wholesale price regardless of the level of demand  a rash of outage ha kept the electricity market conveniently   and very profitably   short of supply even during period of low demand  when there ought to be lot of excess capacity  a frank wolak  the stanford economist who also advises the state  s power grid  ha pointed out  an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick  you can  t tell directly whether he is really sick or ha chosen to take the day off for other reason  but you can look for circumstantial evidence  and such evidence ha convinced mr  wolak that  generator use forced outage strategically to withhold capacity from the market    a view shared by a growing number of other researcher  which brings u to the latest move by the federal energy regulatory commission  on wednesday  the commission apparently decided to offer california some relief  and put new price cap in place on the california electricity market  i say  apparently  because the more you look at the plan the le likely it seems to be any help at all  indeed  the measure wa passed on a   to   vote  with william massey   the one commissioner who ha been sympathetic to call for price control   voting against it on the ground that it would be ineffectual  what  s wrong with ferc  s plan  first  it cap price only in emergency condition   ignoring the fact that electricity price have stayed at hard  to  explain level even when there is no emergency  in effect  the plan is laid out a if the electricity market were really competitive  in spite of all the evidence that it is not  second  even those emergency price cap are full of loophole  offering extensive opportunity for what mr  wolak call  megawatt laundering    selling power to affiliated company that for one reason or another are exempted from the price control  for example  the control do not apply to  import  from neighboring state   then selling it back into the california market  severin borenstein of the university of california energy institute add that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant  generator will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently   i predict we will find some plant we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again  and they will be pretty inefficient   the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan  there are serious proposal to mitigate the crisis out there   indeed  last fall mr  wolak submitted a proposal that wa well received by other expert   but ferc ha ignored all of them  the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn  t get it  that it just can  t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real  the uncharitable interpretation is that last week  s action wa meant to fail  the medley report  an online newsletter  call the ferc plan  a grand exercise in posturing without substance    a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to deflect any political fallout  from the looming disaster  whatever the explanation  the plain fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief   fo  b

subject  var for metal it is my preference to have an aggregated var methodology for the metal business a soon a possible  version la   i do not want to poison progress with my opiniion  but i think that the critical first step is to find a way to aggregate position in coarse bucket  perhaps sacrificing precision for speed  based on  rule  that oerations can deliver  research can stand behind and commercial will accept   and using an equally coarse var calculation  the equivalent of ad  hoc var   that can be delivered to the  official book and record  on a daily basis  this i believe would be acceptable for a    month time frame  at which time we get versionlb  a opposed to waiting    month to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim  ultimately  i would look for version  a to be delivered and very defendable by       this will require indulgence and compromise on all front but i can not conceive of a better way  please let me know if this is consistent with your understanding  a critical point from my perspective is that the mg commercial team and metal operation staff understand their role in making this happen and willingness to accept the consequence  i look for you to take the lead a leader of the integration to do so  if you need any input from the rest of u to underscore the importance please let u know  a i alluded to on the phone  the people in houston that have been involved in the var process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of var by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding by all party a their responsibility  given the distance and the newness of the metal personell  i fear that this could set u all up for some surprise and some very uncomfortable communication  much of which is not entirely necessary  thanks ted eric gadd         am to  ted murphy  hou  ect  ect  bjorn hagelmann  hou  ect  ect cc  richard sage  lon  ect  ect subject  attached fax ted and bjorn  we plan to release draft recommendation on metal position limit by close of business on  july and have asked vince to prepare a v  r computational methodology prior to the    aug bod meeting ,0

spray applied  many company we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect but they haven  t spent the money to test over foam  maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various product  report result to spfa  who in turn will  acquire funding  from u      william b  australia we are in australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayer here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of australian contractor  supplier     or maybe they can put their hand up and let u know at enviroline  powerup  com  au  it isfor the betterof the game that an

aviation magazine and one that i write for is a test international  a new publication that just launched this month  i need any new process you might have that would be used on aircraft  particularly commercial aviation      john c  louisiana i have a foam cat  graco machine and a probler gun with a  tip  i use this setup to spray truck bed liner  my question is can i and how do i spray foam insulation using my equipment  and what are the different type of insulation      murph mahaffey  glas  craft i like the new look of the industry forum      mark w  south carolina i  m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a  thermal barrier   what the hell do you think foam is  if you are saying that anything that can be forced to burn should be covered with a fireproof barrier  then you  d better get busy covering all those truss and joist and plywood up there that are definitely not carrying a class one fire rating  this double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it  icynene is different  it doesn  t burn alone  it doesn  t melt  it doesn  t emit phosgene  doe it smoke in a fire situation  sure  so what  blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it force the foam to eventually burn is about a stupid a blaming foam seat cushion for burning when a gas tank rupture and burn up a car  get real  inspector  you want u to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn  t burn  a for the vaunted r rating system  it is totally bogus  the test is designed to make porous insulation appear to perform better than they actually do  measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer  the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is  year ago  along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they  re still selling everybody  there  s a reason they don  t make refrigerator  freezer cooler coffee cup out of fiberglass or cellulose  think about it      dirk benthien  forum moderator thank you  mark and dik  for your statement above  i also feel that far too often individual and company are too complacent and quietly live with rule and regulation

valuable  secret  to my on  going internet success  let me say  above all else  i don  t believe there are any  true   secret  to success on the net  what you do to become successful in the online world is not a  secret   in my opinion  most successful people follow simple  clear  repeatedly  proven strategy to succeed  whether on the net or off  but  when it come to someone asking for advice  consultation  or simply asking   what  s your secret    i have to blush  say    persistence and personality  of course  i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer  what make me successful may not work the same for you     your first lesson is to get over the deep  seeded idea that success  of any kind  in my opinion  is somehow an unknown  unattainable secret  clearly  it is not  it  s not unknown  it  s not unattainable  it  s not year of digging to find the  secret  to internet rich  one thing that  get to me  so often in my work a an internet consultant  author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stand between themselves and success on the net  it  s almost a if they  ve been

subject  credit applicatiions in grms this note is from ted murphy  not bjorn hagelman  my understanding is that yet another meeting ha been scheduled with the intent of diverting resource from the grms project to some other project  while i am not privy to the urgency of this other project  i do know that we have a very large  multi  phase project going in grms  grms stand for the global risk monitoring system  it is not intended to be a commercial trading product not is it primary purpose for commercial decision  making  conceptually  it is a risk warehouse for the primary purpose of rac due to the deficiency of current front office trading system and their inability to provide timely  aggregated information useful to rac  rac ha spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task list to accomplish it objective  a a firm we are woefully behind our press clipping in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile  my most recent sojorn in europe is a classic example of the current system inabilty to aggregate and meet the need of rac having abetted poor decision making and causing cash loss in well in excess of the grms budget or that of the market risk group in rac  the grms project is a requirement that bill bradford and i have in order to do our job  we have delegated authority to debbie brackett and rudi zipter to make decision regarding priority and a such meet regularly with jonathon and his team a well a rick buy to provide update  while progress is never a fast a we would like it  in every instance in which we have only to rely on rac  jonathon  s team and research to make a deadline it haas been hit  the primary reason for any delay whatsoever ha been the diversion of resource off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other source  most recently the it staff in london wa a tremendous impediment to deadline  please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note  but i feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening  also  i have had several employee come to resignation over their frustration on the lack of management support for this project  usually manifesting itself in the lack of resource or the diversion of resource devoted to it  i think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase project and provide tangible deliverable when not distracted  please let u do our job  i do not denigrate the effort of others  but i believe that they must either submit their detailed requirement to u for our consideration of their worthiness to put in our que or develop their own project with their own resource  thank you for your consideration of this opinion  a it relates to thing that will effect the ability of market risk to do it job  please consult me a i would you  ted,0

crandell  who follows oil service and drilling for the new york investment banker  he emphasized that the gain by the  producer in lehman  s survey reflects increase in budget for  and not underspending of budget during    among the company that were included in our december  and may  survey  global spending actually came in slightly above what wa estimated to have been spent during  in december  it also indicates that nearly   billion ha been added to  worldwide exploration budget since december   crandell said  the survey  s respondent said that they planned to increase u  s  e  p expenditure by    percent  up from    percent earlier in the year  crandell said that the greater increase wa driven almost entirely by independent producer   in our survey   independent indicated e  p spending growth in  of    percent versus a    percent increase budgeted for the year in december   he indicated   some  percent of the independent we surveyed have increased their u  s  e  p budget  while about  percent plan on spending le than what they indicated last december  higher natural gas price and increased cash flow are the main driver behind this   crandell said that anadarko

the increase in canada indicated by the  company in our survey is nothing short of staggering   crandell continued  of the  company that he contacted     percent budgeted higher expenditure for  than for    compared with december   percent of them have increased their estimated spending in  by more than  percent  while  percent have reduced it by more than  percent  the remaining  percent have kept it within  percent of what wa originally estimated   crandell said  talisman energy inc   nyse  tlm  led the group with a huge increase  followed by anderson exploration ltd   tse  axl   gulf

their  e  p budget in response to higher gas price and increased cash flow  according to the lehman analyst  he said that foreign upstream budget were an area of surprise   the    percent gain indicated by the  oil and gas company that have operation outside the united state and canada wa well above the    percent increase for  estimated last december  a in other geography  there were more company that increased budget than decreased them   overall  crandell said that  percent of the surveyed company raised their  e  p budget by more than  percent   estimated expenditure in roughly the same range and  percent indicated that they would spend le than originally planned  he said that the larger increase were driven by some big company which materially increased their budget  including texaco  petroleos brasileiros s  a   petroleos mexicano s  a  and repsol ypf s  a   nyse  rep  among the multinationals and amerada hess  apache  premier oil plc  and woodside energy among mid  sized company  crandell noted that while respondent  average price assumption rose during   s first six month  to     from     per barrel of crude oil and to     from     per thousand cubic foot of natural gas   they still trail current price and what lehman brother estimate for the year    per barrel of crude and     per mcf of gas    this suggests a stronger second half than expected  should company

thursday research lunch or a friday brown bag lunch  thanks  iris      original message      from  nalin kulatilaka  enron com  sent  thursday  march       pm to  mack  iris cc  lin  martin subject  re  possible visit to enron by professor nalin kulatilaka of boston university hi iris i have two different hat to wear in talking to enron  one is a a financial economist  the other a the director of the newly formed  global mobility innovation initiative  gmii    this is the research project funded by lucent  involving bu  lb  and insead  to study various aspect of the mobile internet  read  g   on the former i am working with a couple of ph  d  student in understanding  a  detail of how having physical supply  inventory  can be used by a market maker  this is a problem that ha been study in the context of specialist inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in the way enron doe it in some of the newer market like bandwidth  i think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the ground   b  how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market  this is in many way the critical aspect of real option that most finance people miss   having option is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another  all of the incomplete contracting  asymmetric information  and incentive issue are ignored in real option valuation model  but they are real in practice  my impression is enron  s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problem by imposing a market disciplining   c  how enron manages the various book that involve physicals  financials  credit etc  this is specially important when many of the real asset have option feature and therefore  include non  linear risk profile  the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others market enron ha been moving into over the last few year  on the gmii front  i think that some interesting opportunity arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber  i am working with several people at lucent on this issue  i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folk in the room  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issue  perhaps we can discus some of these over a conference call  clearly  having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me  a for schedule  the first  week of april are horrible  april     may    are good for me  regard nalin at    pm       mack  iris wrote   hi    a we briefly

subject  california update      please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston  x   or kristin walsh  x   with additional question  executive summary an announcement could be made a early a today regarding the first wave of long  term contract  price and term   the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing a davis hatch a plan to   pas on  court ordered rate increase  and   issue revenue bond  audit result are in and question loom about the amount of fund transferred to parent company  davis is expected to use the threat of  endless appeal  in court and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the pressure on the parent company to pay a share of the utility debt  a well a to limit the scope of the rate hike  davis hope that a court ruling in favor of the utility would provide him with the political cover he need to pas on rate hike to california consumer and avoid utility bankruptcy  davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy group  if there is a ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court  ordered rate hike  it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state  legislation and bail out bill ablx wa heard for several hour in the senate appropriation yesterday  issue still remain regarding the tiered rate structure  specifically for community that have harsh climate  however  the bill ha received support from almost everyone including consumer group  the bill is expected to pas sometime today  tim gage  ca director of finance said davis support all the provision in ablx and expected to sign  bill abl  x wa not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear today  in committee hearing monday  the dwr testified it is spent all of the   m and were spending   m  day in the spot market to buy power  according to source with direct access to governor davis  the on  going court battle  a discussed below  is viewed a an excellent opportunity for a settlement  davis recognizes that   the expected court ruling in the cpuc case will likely authorize the utility to increase rate charged to california rate payer    despite that ruling  the state government ha the ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the two utility unless they come to term  thus  davis belief that california consumer can not avoid getting hit with higher electricity charge  but he plan to use the threat of an appeal  and a possible ballot initiative  to limit the amount of the rate hike  a plan to exempt the lowest income  smallest consumer from any rate increase and to concentrate rate increase among consumer using   of a baseline usage rate wa gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento  that would still hit about one half of all consumer  since the  baseline  is set at   of average consumption   but it is  progressive  in a politically important sense  making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night when pg  e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meter for many customer and were estimating their bill based on previous usage rate  the company  s defense  they had laid off meter reader to conserve cash  wa met with widespread derision a consumer advocate pointed out the estimation policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious effort by californian to use le electricity   every time you think there  s a moment when these utility will not embarrass themselves  something like this happens   one legislator moaned  long  term contract a second key to keeping the eventual rate increase down lie in the negotiation now almost complete for the first wave of long  term power buying contract davis initiated earlier this month  the first wave of those contract will be announced perhaps a early a today and they will be surprisingly positive  according to official in the talk   we got a series of good offer in those initial proposal  and some not so good one   one official told our source   the idea is to announce the result of the first contract talk with the good guy and then go back to the others and say   you want in on this with these term   we think we  ll eventually shake loose a lot of supply with this strategy   bankruptcy because of these new dynamic  there is improved market confidence that california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for socal edison and pg  e  even a they are set to miss another round of payment to creditor and supplier today  remember  there is a standstill agreement among creditor not to ask for accelerated payment until feb     we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost by the court case in front of u district judge ronald s  w  lew in los angeles  which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for elected official that make a settlement possible by the end of next week  at the latest  in fact  without that political cover it would be impossible to square all the various circle of this crisis  audit result and ballot initiative market  bush administration official  and perhaps utility company themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizen group will launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of  l to bring all electricity generation back under state control  the threat of a proposition initiative mounted a the two audit of the utility company ordered by the california public utility commission released in the last  hour confirmed two seriously damaging point we have been warning about since mid  january  first  the audit of socal edison confirmed that   billion of the debt the utility claim it owes to energy supplier is actually owed to itself through it corporate holding structure that generates and sell power  second  it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly   billion in profit to the holding company which then used that money to buy back it stock and increase dividend in an effort to keep it stock price up even while it wa going on a debt  issuing binge  the audit of pg  e released late last night wa even more damaging  pg  e management wa sharply criticized for poor decision in failing to react to  clear warning sign of an approaching energy crisis  by not making deep spending cut   including scaling back management salary   the auditor also questioned the utility  s decision to funnel some     billion of it profit since deregulation into the coffer of it parent holding company  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividend and buy back stock   basically  they took the money and ran   a state senate speaker burton put it yesterday  what appears to be governor gray davis  grudging acceptance of reality is actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough rate hike  taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without triggering a new   and far more damaging   burst of populist outrage among a voter base that still think the utility company are basically making this all up  there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and the debt it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the spirit of the  deregulation law  but that is irrelevant in popular political term  were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by the court case discussed below  these audit would make settlement extremely difficult  keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key to understanding the very complex game that davis  his adviser and senior legislator are now playing  a ballot initiative would be a potential disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re  establishing full public control over the electric utility  even if the state and utility successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be year before that victory wa clear and it would freeze all new private investment during that prolonged period  that  s something california can not afford a business would be moving out and new one failing to relocate  court battle thus  legislator are listening in horror a they hear the ugly detail of the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg  e are likely to win in mid  february  the court will most likely grant the two utility     billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulder of consumer who would see bill rise by at least    california politician could see the emergence of the one thing everyone ha needed since the start of this extended drama  political cover  davis will then have to rely on his political and negotiating skill to pressure the parent company of the utility to pas on something le than the full     billion debt  pg  e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed to let them raise electricity rate enough to recover all of the debt they have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them raise price even a electricity price soared  the court said the  deregulation law wa crystal clear   when the two utility had repaid so  called  stranded cost   they were free to begin charging whatever they needed to charge consumer to cover their cost of acquiring power  although the utility won this case  the judge stayed his order until february  th at the state government  s request  a that deadline approach  an intense new negotiating round is under way  on the one hand  political official know they have the ultimate political cover for higher electric price   the court made me do it    but on the other hand  they also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would force electricity rate up by about   on top of natural gas bill that have soared by about   since last year  utility company are playing this card aggressively in negotiation about the scope and shape of the final bailout   we  ll just wait until the court put the order into effect in mid  february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and easily   one tactic the state political official are using  in order to force a settlement  is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the next couple of year  one political official pointed out that they could keep the utility from receiving their money this year  next year or perhaps even the year after   sure  we tell them  they will probably win in court and get that money  eventually  we are making them well aware that unless we have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme court and keep them tied up for the next two year at least  we don  t think the creditor will be quite that patient  ,0

subject  california power      executive summary  sb   x give dept  of water and resource given legislative authority to undertake short  term power purchase with no price cap through feb   nd new legislation  ab   x and sb   x  would seek    long  term contract with    cent cap and    creation of california power and conservation financing authority the long  term contract proposed in ab   x are likely to be subject to significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb   nd expiration of sb   x  the authority proposed in sb   x would have bond issuance power to finance new generation capacity and conservation measure negotiation under way on using bond authority for a utility bailout   utility and state government split over debt obligation of utility parent state borrowing plan and power purchase create credit risk for state treasury  socal edison miss more payment bush administration opposes price cap  but is supporting state effort to split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or issue bond to deal with the rest  a one very senior california political leader explained  getting the utility holding company to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread public outrage about a  bailout  of private price  gouging company with taxpayer money  since   of californian currently blame the utility and the puc for this crisis  and only   blame davis   this is a crucial political stance for the governor  but  of course  absorbing anything like   billion in debt would be quite a shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power  generating branch of the two utility  and they began spreading the word that they were quite willing to accept bankruptcy  thus by mid  week  both side had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court that would be a worst case solution for all side  the country  s economy would suffer from the resulting credit shock  the governor  s political future would suffer from the electricity rate increase almost certain to be mandated by a bankruptcy judge  while most private sector legal authority believe the utility corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during bankruptcy procedure and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of the debt in the end  in addition  they would most likely face a state government determined to use state power of condemnation to enter the power business in a major way  senator burton  s sb  x legislation will strengthen those power dramatically to make this point quite explicit  it would set up a  california power and conservation financing authority   with the power to issue bond and invoke eminent domain  it would finance new power plant  and  consider the feasibility and public interest of the state acquiring  operating  and maintaining transmission facility currently owned by investor  owned and municipal utility   a we write this  all side are trying to construct a path back down from the bankruptcy ledge to safe ground  and there is no question the tone ha shifted in the last  hour from macho confrontation to  maybe we  ve run this thing out a far a we can   but a we have noted  the chance for miscalculation is still quite high  there is no solution agreed to at this time  the stand  off over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utility  holding company is continuing  and the technical fact of default still make it possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate accelerated payment    default update  thursday socal edison    million default to california power exchange  after edison failed to make a   m electricity payment yesterday  the california power authority began seizing long  term contact and reselling them to recoup some of the money owed to generator  pg  e said it expects it trading privilege at the cal  power authority to be suspended today  leaving them with only it generation from nuclear and hydroelectric source  while the ongoing wave of default ha severely restricted pg  e  s and socal  s ability to buy power  the department of water and resource will be able to pick up some of the slack  at least in the very short  term  the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory  the proposed california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of     billion from the state general fund in advance of this year  s expected fiscal surplus  with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future revenue  with near  bankrupt utility and a freeze on rate hike  it is unclear where the revenue would come from  the amount borrowed and term of repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating agency    bush policy a we reported on wednesday  the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved in the california crisis  president  elect bush surprised state leader yesterday with his comment  which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation wa the root of the current supply shortage  bush and his top official appear to be unanimously opposed to long  term price cap  however  there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration  according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor  there is significant concern that pg  e  s credit problem could cause gas supplier to stop shipment of gas through pg  e  s pipeline  the risk would be that the pipeline could  go dry   causing significant and possibly dangerous disruption in california residence and business  to prevent this problem  bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg  e into separate gas and electric company  the gas company would be solvent  but the electric company would go immediately into ch   following significant default ,0

behavior in the world   million u household   billion  purchase   along with sophisticated modeling capability to help predict customer response to various offer at the household level  given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition cost in retail energy market  we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailer target their direct marketing effort toward the residential customer most likely to respond to whatever the offer is   improving the efficiency of mailing and other promotional campaign  so there is an efficiency angle  see   because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchase  our result tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic  based model  so far  the the response from utility and  new entrant  i  ve been talking to so far ha been quite positive  and we have some test of our data underway  but we  re interested in talking to a many player in the market a possible a we develop specific product to meet utility need  i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested  but i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the  th of april with whoever at enron might have interest in hearing what we  re up to  and  most importantly  listening to what your data need might be a you enter new market

subject  preface for book vince   hope you are well   we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book  and you kindly offered that you would provide this   is this still possible   we realise that you are extremely busy  so chris and le went ahead and wrote something  which is below  and if you want to review  change or re  write  the preface  that would be very appreciated   let me know what your thought are   thanks  julie  we  re getting close    preface    one of our main objective in writing energy derivative  pricing and risk management ha been to bring together a many of the various approach for the pricing and risk management energy derivative a possible  to discus in  depth the model  and to show how they relate to each other   in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different model  price a wide range of energy derivative  or to build a risk management system which us a consistent modelling framework   we believe that for practitioner this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our article and presentation the danger of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunity to your competitor by using ad  hoc and inconsistent model for different instrument and market  see also others who propose consistent model     however  it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or model  at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user  although it will probably be clear from our discussion the model  s  we prefer    we therefore try and give a clear account a possible of the advantage and disadvantage of all the model so that the reader can make an informed choice a to the model which best suit their need   in order to meet our objective the book is divided into  chapter   in chapter  we give an overview of the fundamental principal needed to model and price energy derivative which will underpin the remainder of the book   in addition to introducing the technique that underlie the black  scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical technique of trinomial tree and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing  which are used throughout the book   in chapter  we discus the analysis of spot energy price   a well a analysing empirical price movement we propose a number of process that can be used to model the price   we look at the well  know process of geometric brownian motion a well a mean reversion  stochastic volatility and jump process  discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameter estimated   chapter   written by vince kaminski  grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp   discus volatility estimation in energy commodity market   this chapter build on the previous one   it examines in detail the method  merit and pitfall of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing model introduced in chapter    example from crude  gas  and electricity market are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspect of calculating volatility   chapter  examines forward curve in the energy market   although such curve are well understood and straight  forward in the most financial market  the difficulty of storage in many energy market lead to le well defined curve   in this chapter we describe forward price bound for energy price and the building of forward curve from market instrument   we outline the three main approach which have been applied to building forward curve in energy market  the arbitrage approach  the econometric approach  and deriving analytical value by modelling underlying stochastic factor   chapter  present an overview of structure found in the energy derivative market and discus their us   example of product analysed in this chapter include a variety of swap  cap  floor and collar  a well a energy swaptions  compound option  asian option  barrier option  lookback option  and ladder option   chapter  investigates single and multi  factor model of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivative   closed form solution for forward price  forward volatility  and european option price both on the spot and forward are derived and presented for all the model in this chapter including a three factor  stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model   chapter  show how the price of path dependent and american style option can be evaluated for the model in chapter    simulation scheme are developed for the evaluation of european style option and applied to a variety of path dependent option   in order to price option which incorporate early exercise opportunity  a trinomial tree scheme is developed   this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic a well a standard european and american style option   chapter  describes a methodology for valuing energy option based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve   the approach result in a multi  factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curve   the user defined volatility structure can be of an extremely general form   closed  form solution are developed for pricing standard european option  and efficient monte carlo scheme are presented for pricing exotic option   the chapter close with a discussion of the valuation of american style option   chapter  focus on the risk management of energy derivative position   in this chapter we discus the management of price risk for institution that trade option or other derivative and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time   we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivative and look at extension to gamma hedging   illustrating the technique using both spot and forward curve model   the general model presented in chapter  is ideally suited to multi  factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivative and this is also discussed   chapter  examines the key risk management concept of value at risk  var  applied to portfolio containing energy derivative product   after discussing the concept of the measure  we look at how the key input  volatility  covariance  correlation  etc  can be estimated   we then compare the four major methodology for computing var  delta  delta  gamma  historical simulation and monte  carlo simulation  applying each to the same portfolio of energy option   in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimate for various underlying energy market variable   finally  in chapter  we review modelling approach to credit risk   we look in detail at two quite different approach  creditmetrics  j  p  morgan     and creditrisk   credit suisse financial product     for which detailed information is publicly available   together these provide an extensive set of tool with which to measure credit risk   we present numerical example of applying these technique to energy derivative   before we begin we stress that the model and method we present in this book are tool which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the   tool   and the market work   the technique we describe are certainly not   magic wand   which can be waved at data and risk management problem to provide instant and perfect solution   to quote from the riskmetrics technical document     no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk      however  the right tool  correctly used make the job a lot easier ,0

subject  re  pre  submitted question on espeak erin  a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent non  technical introduction to real option and it contains all the most important reference to more advanced book and paper  the book ha an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page  the research group offered several one  day seminar on real option and application to the energy industry  we still have a few binder with the presentation material available if you are interested  we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall  the first part of the seminar  about  hour in the morning  cover general concept of real option and their applicability to the energy business  the second  more technical afternoon session  cover stochastic process used to model price uncertainty in the energy market and specific case study  valuation of natural gas storage facility and of peaking gas  fired power plant   the real option approach ha been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decision under uncertainty  nobody in this field claim that this is a perfect tool  but it represents a significant progress compared to other technique developed earlier  discounted cash flow analysis that try to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several  in most case  arbitrary scenario  most likely  optimistic  pessimistic   these scenario don  t identify explicitly the risk driver and don  t specify the future proactive management decision  the real  option approach is very powerful because it allows to    capture uncertainty in an explicit way and    to design investment project that allow to exploit future positive development and reduce future exposure to downside risk  this approach allows also create a link between investment decision and future operational decision  forward  looking investment decision create option that are exercised in the future through active management of a project  the real option technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tool to come up with the representation of future possible state of the world  the real challenge is to use these tool in a sensible way  i have seen in my career  almost  year of applying mathematical tool to business and economic problem  many quants armed with powerful computer who reminded me of monkey armed with hammer  the challenge is not to run mechanically thousand of simulation based on arbitrary assumption but to translate in a creative way the insight of people who understand specific business into parsimonious quantitative model  it is especially critical to stress  test the assumption of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumption  if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumption  i remember that in the early eighty quite a few model simulated the dynamic of oil price  but all the stochastic scenario represented fluctuation around a very optimistic upward trend  one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what economics  teach about cartel and the dynamic of supply and demand  enron north america corp  from  erin rice  enron         pm to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect cc  subject  pre  submitted question on espeak good news  there is already a question waiting for your july  espeak session  i have pasted it below  although you don  t have to respond until the actual event  don  t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topic if you would still like u to advertise the event on the elevator screen  thanks   er submitted by breineck i wa doing some reading about the application of real option in the evaluation of non  financial asset  would you recommend any text or article for a more in  depth study of this area  is quantification of risk or uncertainty the major challenge in using this concept  can statistical tool be used with this to do a sort of sensitivity analysis ,0

com  sent  thursday  march       pm to  mack  iris cc  lin  martin subject  re  possible visit to enron by professor nalin kulatilaka of boston university hi iris i have two different hat to wear in talking to enron  one is a a financial economist  the other a the director of the newly formed  global mobility innovation initiative  gmii    this is the research project funded by lucent  involving bu  lb  and insead  to study various aspect of the mobile internet  read  g   on the former i am working with a couple of ph  d  student in understanding  a  detail of how having physical supply  inventory  can be used by a market maker  this is a problem that ha been study in the context of specialist inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in the way enron doe it in some of the newer market like bandwidth  i think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the ground   b  how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market  this is in many way the critical aspect of real option that most finance people miss   having option is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another  all of the incomplete contracting  asymmetric information  and incentive issue are ignored in real option valuation model  but they are real in practice  my impression is enron  s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problem by imposing a market disciplining   c  how enron manages the various book that involve physicals  financials  credit etc  this is specially important when many of the real asset have option feature and therefore  include non  linear risk profile  the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others market enron ha been moving into over the last few year  on the gmii front  i think that some interesting opportunity arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber  i am working with several people at lucent on this issue  i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folk in the room  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issue  perhaps we can discus some of these over a conference call  clearly  having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me  a for schedule  the first  week of april are horrible  april     may    are good for me  regard nalin at    pm       mack  iris wrote   hi    a we briefly discussed  i spoke with one of my colleague  dr   martin lin  about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  time

subject  re  houston research opportunity  anjam vince  here is an explanation of what a  month package for anjam actually entail  it seems to me that anjam  s interest in getting an expat package is mostly about money  based on the uk hr  s read of anjam  they think he will jump  i have a telephone conference with anjam at     my stance will be  is firm  we will help with the transition via a one time settlement  flat rental issue   lb of air shipping for moving furniture  maybe one trip back to uk a year  but no more  re  his concern of having a place in london should he want to return  i will say that vince would be far better at finding a good spot for you than any hr type  so that part of the  package  promise is not particularly important  any guideline for me to follow  coach  regard  grant                        forwarded by grant masson  hou  ect on         am                            tara rozen         am to  grant masson  hou  ect  ect cc  melanie doyle  lon  ect  ect  jane allen  hou  ect  ect subject  re  houston research opportunity grant not sure if i told you that i work mon  wed  friday hence the delay in responding  sorry if i forgot to tell you  another contact name in my absence who will be able to assist is jane allen in houston  cc  ed above   three main reason we try to stay away from assignment to the u for this type  level of transfer are    cost   equitability among other peer   difficulty in transferring employee to local package from assignment package  however  if this is truly a  month assignment with no intention of extension  we would normally do the following   month assignment london base  car allowance  and benefit and national insurance contribution cost  currently     of all comp compared with     of all comp plus     up to max of   k of employer u contribution  housing cost in houston paid if maintaining housing in the uk  usually up to   per month for single  utility cost if maintaining a house in the uk  up to   per month home leave  two economy trip per year is standard transportation to  from assignment  economy class transportation in houston  we normally give this  up to   per day for rental car in addition to the person  s car allowance a they normally do not require a car in the uk and take the car allowance a a cash benefit whereas they will require a car in houston  shipment of good   lb air tax assistance disturbance allowance  normally pay approx   so  in term of cost if you just compare a local u salary of manager on   k to a local uk manager on o  k the u total cost is approx   k  the uk cost is approx   k  then if you add the above cost to the assignment  you will see an even greater increase in cost compared with the local peer  ie approx   k compared with   k  we do have the ability to change the above in any way a there is no set policy  however  anjam ha already brought up other people  s assignment and i have a feeling he will do his best to find out what everyone else is receiving  if we make clear  though  that we are keeping on uk payroll but not providing any assignment type allowance just in order for him to maintain his pension contribution for the year and at which point a decision will need to be made  return or move to local u   then we may be able keep more consistency with your group while maintaining more reasonable cost  not sure how you want to play this  though  even if he doe go on assignment rather than transfer locally  there is still the issue of whether or not a suitable job will be here at the end of the  month  we will always do our best to find suitable postions but we can not guarantee it  if he transfer to a local u contract  enron europe  s responsibility of finding suitable employment is pretty much nil  i hope this ha made thing clearer rather than more complicated  i honestly feel that ajnam will absolutely not take this position if it is not on an assignment basis  he made it pretty clear that unless he could stay on uk payroll for  month  he would not transfer  call me if you would like to discus  tara  x  enron capital  trade resource corp  from  grant masson         to  tara rozen  lon  ect  ect cc  subject  re  houston research opportunity tara  thanks for the update  it seems anjam is playing hard ball a little  my initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer  but on second thought  could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a   month assignment when you have a moment  compensation  benefit  responsibility  career path implication  etc  many thanks  regard  grant ,0

subject  option hedging for ee eugene  bob and i had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday  for an option writer  he ha the obligation to deliver  so he hedge it with the underlying by adjesting delta position  the hedging cost  theoretically  should be equal to the fair value of the option premium  on the other hand  for the option holder  he ha no obligation  by delta heging  he would pay double for the option  with no upside  so he should not hedge it at all  if the option holder want to protect the time value of the option  he should sell the option to the market or some equivalent option to create a theta  neutral portfolio  this may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option underlyings  our question to you  if the call option you mentioned are embedded in the ee contract  say fixed price sale contract  what make it possible to just separate those option and sell them to the market to retain the full value of the option  we conjecture that these option are meant to hedge the original contract  by selling those option you eliminate the upside of the original contract  give one of u a call if you want to discus this further  zimin,0

 ect  simon hastings  lon  ect  ect  paul d  arcy  lon  ect  ect  amir ghodsian  lon  ect  ect subject  re  var correlation scenario thanks tanya  these are interesting result  i am on vacation next week  so here are my current thought  i am contactable on my mobile if necessary  gas to power correlation i see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting var for the combined gas and power portfolio  and this raise an interesting point  at a conservative   long term correlation  combined var is olmm le than previously expected  so how doe this affect the limit breach  strictly speaking  we are still over our uk power limit  but the limit wa set when we were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio var  a suggested way forward given the importance of the spread option to the uk gas and power book  can we allocate to the gas and power book a share of the reduction in portfolio var  ie  reduction  portfolio var  sum  power var  gas var    also  if i understand your mail correctly  matrix  implies   gas power correlation is consistent with our correlation curve  and this reduces total var by ol   mm  efa slot correlation the issue of whether our existing efa to efa correlation matrix is correct is a separate issue  i don  t understand where the matrix  efa to efa correlation come from  but i am happy for you to run some historical correlation from the forward curve  use the first  year  i would suggest   our original matrix wa based on historicals  but the analysis is worth doing again  your matrix  result certainly indicate how important these correlation are  closing thought friday  s trading left u longer so i would not expect a limit breach on monday  we are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve  and i  d like to wait until both simon hastings and i are back in the office  monday week  before finalising this  regard richard tanya tamarchenko         to  oliver gaylard  lon  ect  ect  richard lewis  lon

enron  ted murphy  hou  ect  ect cc  subject  re  var correlation scenario everybody  oliver sent u the var number for different correlation for uk  power portfolio separately from uk  gas portfolio  first  if var is calculated accurately the correlation between power and gas curve should not affect var number for power and var number for gas  only the aggregate number will be affected  the change you see are due to the fact that we use monte  carlo simulation method  which accuracy depends on the number of simulation  even if we don  t change the correlation but use different realization of random number  we get slightly different result from the model  so  to see the effect of using different correlation between gas and power we should look at the aggregate number  i calculated weighted correlation based on  curve i got from paul  a the weight along the term structure i used the product of price  position and volatility for each time bucket for gas and each of efa slot  the result are shown below  inserting these number into the original correlation matrix produced negatively definite correlation matrix  which brake var engine  correlation matrix for any set of random variable is non  negative by definition  and remains non  negatively definite if calculated properly based on any historical data  here  according to our phone discussion  we started experimenting with correlation  assuming the same correlation for each efa slot and et elec versus gas  i am sending you the spreadsheet which summary the result  in addition to the aggregate var number for the run oliver did  you can see the var number based on correlation matrix  and matrix   in matrix  the correlation across efa slot are identical to these in original matrix  i obtained this matrix by trial and error  matrix  is produce by naveen using finger  s algorithm  it differs from original matrix across efa slot a well a in power versus gas correlation and give higher var than matrix  doe  concluding  we will look at the historical forward price and try to calculate historical correlation from them  tanya  oliver gaylard         pm to  richard lewis  lon  ect  ect  james new  lon  ect  ect  steven leppard  lon  ect  ect  rudy dautel  hou  ect  ect  kirstee hewitt  lon  ect  ect  naveen andrew  corp  enron  enron  tanya tamarchenko  hou  ect  ect  david port  market risk  corp  enron  enron cc  subject  var correlation scenario the result were a follows when changing the gas  power correlation  correlation var  uk power book var  uk gas book    ol    mm o    mm    ol    mm o    mm    ol    mm o    mm    ol    mm o    mm    cholesky decomposition failed  not positive definite     cholesky decomposition failed  not positive definite     cholesky decomposition failed  not positive

decomposition failed  not positive definite  peak and off peak were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix  s integrity  interesting to note that for a higher correlation of    the power var increase which is counter to intuition  this implies that we need to look into how the correlation are being applied within the model  once we can derive single correlation from the term structure  is the next action to understand how they are being applied and whether the model capture the p  l volatility in the spread option deal  from    onwards the var calculation failed  oliver,0

second quarter of  this committee wa mandated to review and award contract to the tune of u   million u dollar to a group of five firm for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe line in

dollar with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of u   miilion amongst ourselves  the federal government of nigeria ha since the second quater of year  approved the sum of u   million for u a the contract sum  and the sum of u   million ha also been paid to the foreign company concerned a contract entitlement for the various contract done  but since the company are entiltled to u   million dollar only  we are now left with u   million dollar balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves  but by virtue of our position a civil servant and member of this panel  we can not do this by ourselves  a we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  civil service law  from opening and  or operating foreign account in our name while still in government service  making it impossible for u to acquire the money in our name right now  i have therefore  been delegated a a matter of trust and urgency by my colleague in the panel to look for an overseas

subject  re  eol pricing algorithm hi bob  some comment    you request enron position after successful market order  but not after limit order   you may want it after limit order a well to be consistent  i am not clear on how you would use enron position  it is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bid and offer in such a way a to try to achieve that target position  but this target position probably change continuously and is not stored anywhere  and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual enron position to  of course  enron position may still provide some insight    you request bid  mid  ask price for each trade    given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order  especially for limit order   would you need the evolution or range of bid  mid  ask over this time interval  time of order to time of execution   also  for failed trade  you may need the evolution or range of bid  mid  ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection  this again mainly applies to limit order  a the time interval may not be significant for market order given the speed of execution  something to check        original message      from  lee  bob sent  monday  april       am to  kaminski  vince  shanbhogue  vasant  barkley  tom cc  lu  zimin  huang  alex  gibner  stinson subject  eol pricing algorithm a draft data request for eol data we would use to study p  l pattern for the  george  pricing algorithm is attached for your review  i would like to send this to andy zipper and jay webb this afternoon  bob ,0

on in poland    power market  s vast    emerging europe  enron plug on in poland    power market  s vast potential hold allure  but an uncertain future    after six year  profit from company  s power operation remains year away by elizabeth williamson      the wall street journal europe   copyright  c    dow jones  company  inc   nowa sarzyna  poland   from a small power plant humming among the birch near the ukrainian border  enron corp  ha staked it claim on the polish energy market  yet after six year  the company is still seeking a mother lode  the houston  based energy producer and trader entered poland in   nabbed one of the first power  trading license to go to a foreign company and began work on elektrocieplownie nowa sarzyna  poland  s first new  foreign  operated heat  and  power plant  other company followed  including electricite de france  rwe ag of germany  vattenfall ab of sweden and tractebel sa of belgium  the prize could be a rich one  all of these company hope to profit a poland sell it state energy asset and free price before joining the european union  a wholesale power bourse is due to open in warsaw in july  and the country  s transmission link to market east and west could make poland the power  trading hub of central europe  but after six year in poland  enron ha yet to earn a profit  net income from nowa sarzyna  which is to begin commercial production later this month  is at least five year away  power  trading operation might generate profit next year  if the new bourse get moving  but that is  one big question mark   say jarek astramowicz  enron poland  s president  indeed  despite it promise  poland  s energy sector remains a sizzling tangle of aging plant  archaic market agreement and complex  shifting regulation  enron  with   billion     billion euro  in annual revenue  is an innovator and an investment bellwether for it peer  but in a power market a negatively charged a poland  s  the company also is an example of how shaky market condition can keep even the savviest competitor offline   these are very large operation and to some extent they can bear some risk   say pawel kaminski  energy  sector operation officer at the world bank in warsaw   but eventually they have to generate some return   enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u  s  it entered europe in   setting up in london a the u  k   s energy sector liberalized  it entered the nordic market in   and today is the nord pool  s largest  volume trader  enron say it take about two year to find a site and obtain permit for a power plant  and a further  month for construction  just four year after entering the u  k   enron finished it     megawatt teesside plant  teesside  s capacity and cost  at gbp  million     billion euro   are many time larger than nowa sarzyna  s  yet teesside wa completed in only two  third the time  the company decline to compare development time in various country   i wouldn  t necessarily put poland into the same category a russia   say philip davy  regulatory and government  affair manager at enron europe in london   but obviously  given poland  s  planned economy  past  it probably take a bit longer to work through the regulatory process and get to the starting point   at nowa sarzyna  it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach the starting point  even though mr  astramowicz already knew the site  and the polish power industry  s rule  the nowa sarzyna plant wa mr  astramowicz  s brainchild  and he burned out the engine in his first bmw a he traveled between warsaw and the town to craft the deal  a freelance energy  sector entrepreneur before joining enron  mr  astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna to enron in   enron ha spent   million to build nowa sarzyna  a   megawatt  gas  fired combined heat  and  power plant  quiet  clean and efficient  the plant stand in stark contrast to most of poland  s belching  coal  fired behemoth  when it start up this month  it will sell it electricity to the polish power grid  the country  s high  voltage network  under a   year power  purchase agreement  or ppa  that enron won in   steam output go to organika  the chemical company next door  and help heat the town of nowa sarzyna  the nowa sarzyna plant is more than   financed by commercial  bank loan for which the only collateral is the plant  s concluded contract   they were betting on their good name   say michael davy  a partner with allen  overy  the warsaw law firm that advised enron poland  s lender   they are pushing envelope all the time   that is especially true in a market with   overcapacity  where an energy law didn  t even exist until   say peter bisztyga  emerging europe utility analyst at solomon smith barney in london   because enron signed a ppa  they are ok     but  i  m really not sure building nowa sarzyna wa such a good idea   mr  bisztyga say enron could have generated a faster return by renovating an existing power plant  but  he acknowledges  nowa sarzyna  allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name on it   in   polish power plant weren  t for sale  energy asset privatization  discussed for year  began in earnest only this year  by   the polish government proposes to sell off stake in dozen of power plant   distribution company and the polish power grid  a     kilometer national transmission network of high  voltage line  the asset have a total book value of  billion zloty     billion euro   but murky regulation have driven price down   the regulation don  t promote competition and so you don  t really know the price of electricity   say bengt wegemo  president of vattenfall poland  earlier this year  vattenfall paid   million for   in warsaw  based elektrocieplownie warszawskie  promising   million in investment in the heat  and  power plant over the next  year  investor hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing  ultimately   licensed energy trader and  large power user will trade on the bourse  setting the wholesale price of electricity  the polish bourse will be modeled on it nordic counterpart  enron  the nord pool  s largest trader  hope to post polish trading profit by   but first  say market expert  poland  s  energy law must be amended to ease functioning of the bourse  and free up access to poland  s distribution network  further  the government say it must solve the competition problem posed by the polish power grid  s power  purchase agreement  which account for   of energy sale in poland  some state  owned plant used the agreement a collateral to secure modernization financing  when price are freed  these plant might go bankrupt if forced to compete with plant that didn  t spend money to modernize  the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the modernized plant for their extra cost  though nowa sarzyna is a private plant  the price enron must charge for it power is about twice what outmoded plant charge   we are hoping that continuous  efficient operation of the plant will generate u a  bigger  profit   mr  astramowicz say  another problem is cross  border power trading  where contradictory legislation essentially give a monopoly to the polish power grid  also known a pse  enron and others protest that pse shouldn  t compete with electricity  market participant who contract with it for transmission service  pse intends to stay in the trading business  say marek zerka  pse  s vice president  in late march  pse and local company kulczyk holding signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export electricity and coal to eu country via germany   this is great news   mr  astramowicz say   if this joint venture get access to pse  s cross  border transmission capacity    i would expect pse to confirm open access to all market participant   enron and others are pushing hard for that access   a soon a the market becomes open  free and non  discriminatory  we will come out at a decent profit   mr  astramowicz say  folder name  enron in europe relevance score on scale of    to review or revise your folder  visit http    www

structure we put together  on the mark  to  market issue  bob and his colleague wess told me that a long a payment are tied to one particular plant  we can not m  t  m them  they had same problem with plant here in the u  like the peaking plant  and they had to separate the plant from power sale to be able to m  t  m the assocated cashflows  what they did is  they sold power from the plant to an outside party and bought it back from them at completely different  multiple  location  the buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket  even if enron can somehow mark  to  market a deal with dpc  it can do so for only   of the cashflows because only   of dpc is owned by outsider  and a simple loan to an affiliate can not also be marked to market  bob wa suggesting that if eipl buy option from dpc and from some other plant and in turn sell power to ap or karnataka then we could have a case for m  t  m  politically dpc selling power to eipl may not be the best solution  to put it rather mildly  our alternative  a i see them  are   do the deal a we structured it  the only difference is that enron doesn  t mark it to market and income is earned only in       do the deal a we structured it  eipl  enron then sell the contract to another party at a profit  the problem  of course  is finding this party and forking part of the profit to them    same deal  except revenue securitization is done through an outside party in india  not eipl   bob said he will think about the issue some more this week  let me know when you will be here next week so we can meet with bob together  i will be going to boston for tuesday and  or wednesday  feb       i can book an appt  with bob for u  sandeep kohli  enron _ development         pm to  robert butt  pinnamaneni krishnarao

continue the analysis on mark  to  market that i had spoken to you about on the phone  i thought that it wa getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone  so i am having krishnarao who is in vince  s group explain the transaction to you  krishna ha been helping u structure the deal here in india  and he ha just returned to houston from india after working with the team here  he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction  i would like you to please spend some time with him  and then based on the discussion please send u a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market  please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transaction from the indian side  this is a very important transaction for u  and we may need to repeat this in coming month  hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it  also  what i am concerned about is that there will be an enron india  eipl  account in india based on indian gaap  and upon consolidation there will be a u gaap accounting in the u  it is here that we would like to have mark  to  market accounting  eipl is structured through mauritius  and then cayman island  another key question to consider is that when we m  t  m the transaction in the u there will be a tax accruing in the year of m  t  m  say    however  in india  a a result of the accrual accounting  there will not be any income showing till the year  or   we will need to know how that would get treated  and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the u  i am also confused about whether u tax would be levied  since none of the income is being brought back into the u  remains overseas  subpart  f and other concern   finally  we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the u  this is still not allowed to indian corporates   i need you to think about this too  and see if some type of accounting will solve

subject  update  reimbursement of individually billed item the use of cell phone and pager ha increased dramatically in the past few year  a a result the account payable department ha seen a rapid increase in the number of invoice and vendor  with the higher volume  we have reviewed our process in order to continue our rapid payment cycle  although we encourage vendor to address their invoice to individual employee  they often mail invoice directly to account payable  at time they fail to list the individual who us the pager or cell phone  in these case we return the invoice to the vendor  if the employee is designated  we try to track him  her down and forward the invoice  the high level of employee movement among job and location at enron ha made this increasingly challenging  either way  we end up doing something le productive than paying invoice  to maintain satisfactory response to our vendor and to reduce time necessary for research  we request that employee who have pager  cell phone  and other individually billed item such a license  subscription  etc   pay for them by personal check or charge card  if applicable   payment instruction are usually indicated on the invoice  and request reimbursement through employee expense report  by submitting these charge on your expense report  you can help u reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoice  the number of check generated by treasury  the number of vendor in our database  and the turnaround time for payment of invoice  incidentally  account payable is currently installing a corporate  wide web  based expense reporting system similar to what enron international ha used for the past year  this will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement  we   d like to make this effective immediately  if you have any question or suggestion  please contact the account payable department ,0

thuraisingham  enron communication  subject  material for thu  mar wg meeting hello all  appended below you  ll find a summary of idea that people have contributed since we at caida began to get the metric wg started  some of this material ha already appeared on the metric mailing list  the older material come from personal email  i  m posting it again to give u all some more idea to think about  for those who are able to attend the wg meeting in san jose this thursday   mar   i  d like to spend time in the morning getting to know about attendee interest and experience in making internet measurement  i suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a short   minute  response time  and this get even more interesting    you only need  to be able to see traffic in one direction  from client to server  to  get a fairly accurate round  trip time from the client to the server   irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement  host   because of tcp three  way handshake for connection  establishment  when you see the opening syn  you wait for the client  to ack the server  s syn ack and you have the client   server round  trip  time  i think you  ve actually already done some of this  we could  also potentially try to correlate dns query and tcp connection   perhaps determining some probability in a given environment of a  host initiating a tcp connection to a host for which it just received  an a record  and track various application  level response time  i  d  personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of dns response  time to tcp transfer time for http connection   even if the  measurement make no attempt to discern what constitutes a web  transaction to the user  a full page  usually many tcp connection     anyway  i think there are some fairly interesting thing we can  measure with simple technique  these are just some simple one   there may be some interesting thing we could do by digging into  payload of a few of the other highly  utilized application  but doing  it for tcp is a nightmare perfomance  wise  but we now have the basic  infrastructure to do thing with dns over udp  we can probably cover  any open udp protocol without incurring performance penalty that  would make it completely unusable  snmp  for example    while it  application is limited  network service provider would find  round  trip time information for snmp packet from their network  management station to agent very useful  i think there are some  rudimentary thing we can do with tcp a well  and i also think some  site would be interested in having some rudimentary information  for  example  a weighted  by traffic  round  trip time distribution for tcp  traffic to  from all network with which you communicated  say at    granularity   this give site a notion of how close they are to  those they talk to most frequently  with a little more work  we could  probably make reasonable bandwidth estimate for every end network for  which we see tcp data  we could certainly get a reasonable number for  the maximum observed bandwidth     these method also decouple the measurement from the traffic  while we  all know the value of that  i think it  s significant in that active  probers can be run on the same host  decoupled from the actual  measurement  and with timestamps coming from kernel space  bpf   i  ve  been thinking about this for a long time  because eventually i  d like  skitter  and other tool  to be able to do use tcp packet for probing   with no need for thing like ip firewall code  if i can just properly  time non  blocking connects  and count on the passive tool to see the syn  and syn ack  i can use any tcp port for round  trip time measurement and  not trick my kernel by sending tcp packet on a raw socket  i need  feedback from the passive tool for tracing like skitter  it need to  know when a reply ha been seen from a hop and when the destination ha  been reached   but it  s not difficult  simple bytestream  oriented ipc is  sufficient     going further  i like the idea proposed by some others  maybe funded at  this point  i  m not tracking it  of instrumenting the freenix tcp  ip  stack  a lot of useful information could be pulled from the stack   but eventually someone  s going to have to come up with what piece of  information are desirable enough for someone to want their stack  instrumented  and it  ll have to be somewhere between what  s currently   implemented and a full  blown metering system like rtfm   and i think in  the interim  there are a lot of thing we could do using libpcap on our  local machine  non  promiscuous and in user space  safe  easy to  implement and test   to me the benefit here are     a user is likely to have a tangible  well  understood relationship  with their workstation  understood by them   this is particularly  true for those of u with network expertise  so it  s at least  plausible that we can find correlation of measurement with  user experience in a fairly short period of time  helping u hone in  on what  s useful  even if we only find weak correlation  for  whatever reason   once a correlation exists  more people will be  interested in helping with development because it  ll be something  they  ll use personally    we  re essentially guaranteed to see traffic in both direction    i  d personally be interested in trying to find some small set of  information that correlate to user experience  so that it doesn  t  take a terabyte of disk and  processor to deal with data from say     desktop       anyway  just some random thought  the hard part for me at the moment  is thinking about useful generalization and infrastructure to support  them    cindy bickerstaff responded    we  re just starting to capture the ms and window size negotiation between  timeit and server to get an idea of what is typical or usual  wonder if  daniel  s code could do that too from the various traffic monitoring point  caida ha out there  the data could be used to fill in some parameter for  trying to model some of the passive data collected  since a typical web page  ha many element between a single client and server the first or base page  give you a starting idea of what to expect and the subsequent element are  like repeat measurement of the same path over a very short time interval   since there is a strong time of day  week effect  volume and perf   the  short duration of the data collection from a single web page  incl   element  might give some option for modeling  and maybe getting a better  estimate of packet loss   i  ve really enjoyed joining the e  e  interest group  for the idea on factor and the reference to past modeling attempt  e  g   mathis  et  al  paper    ack it bulk transfer focus   paul krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on detail of how to measure common metric like availability  reliability  throughput and latency   an example wa throughput  since it wa proposed  that this be measured using a tcp file transfer of  random data  one concern wa what doe this do  to latency  and where doe this get measured  a  many customer of this service would not be large  business  measuring this from the customer end  of a   or   kbps circuit wa almost certain to  drive end  to  end latency measurement beyond  defined bound  measuring it from within point in  the provider  s network  s  might show figure that the  customer could never see themselves    the compromise wa to define the throughput metric  a ocurring at access link load of no more than    of the bit rate  but how doe one measure that  and  so on      given that this discussion wa recognized a being the  prelude to the imposition of minimal slas  a part of the   certification  process for service provider  this may be  an illustration of the peril of discussing slas and metric  in some interchangable form  but they may not be easy  to separate in the mind of some  carter bullard said  i  m specifically interested in bridging  rtfm and ippm work  particularly to describe how an  rtfm can be a generic connectivity monitor  ippm  describes type  p  unidirection and bidirectional  connectivity  and a single point rtfm can detect  these condition  but standard description for how  this can be done would be very useful    personally  one of the thing that i  m interested  in is tcp based streaming service performance  such  a that seen in internet radio distribution  and of  course ip telephony wireline performance metric would  be very good to describe  nevil brownlee comment that he  s also very interested in developing the rtfm meter a a platform for more general measurement  two area seem interesting  apart from getting more information from tcp stream     qos  difserv performance  what metric do we need to characterise this    ipsec  what metric will still be useful when we can  t look at port number  what kind of traffic can still be identified   curtis

subject  new update on ppi model for inflation book  final version dear all  attached is anjam  s reasoning and final version of the uk ppi pllu model  the uk inflation book  s main exposure is to two ppi index  the pllu and the dzcv through year   both are ppi output index with very comparable basket  the only significant difference between the two is the presence of energy in the pllu        the model in use escalates the two index by the same factor  however  with the energy price fluctuation in recent year different model for the two index would reflect better the nature of their driver  anjam concentrated on the pllu index first and he will shortly construct one for the dzcv based on the same methodology  but without the brent crude curve  the new model achieves the two main objective of the ppi curve  it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one  and it is considerably le sensitive to the input coefficient  this will result in u having more confidence in our monthly p  l a well a le fluctuation  best regard  martina x  anjam ahmad         to  martina angelova  lon  ect  ect cc  subject  new update on ppi model for inflation book dear all  i followed up on the suggestion of happening babe at the conference call a follows     use le data unfortunately  kicking out only  make the overall equation a lot le robust  in fact dramatically so  and so eliminates the possibility of using le data  the model tested wa the rpi  month    ppi pre  empts the move in rpi by about  month  the magnitude of the oscillation is also reduced  this show that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve  then the ppi model would reflect those peak and hump adequately  conclusion i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi  rpi  t    and deviation of brent crude from long  term average  the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue  please note that all this analysis only applies to pllu  and that a separate study will be needed for the dzcv ppi index  regard  anjam x                        forwarded by anjam ahmad  lon  ect on                                    anjam ahmad         to  martina angelova  lon  ect  ect  harry arora  hou  ect  ect  maureen raymond  hou  ect  ect  zimin lu  hou  ect  ect  farouk lalji  hou  ect  ect cc  trena mcfarland  lon  ect  ect  dale surbey  lon  ect  ect  stinson gibner  hou  ect  ect  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  leandro ibasco  corp  enron  enron subject  update on ppi model for inflation book dear all  we thought it might be useful to incorporate brent crude a an explanatory variable for ppi  it wa found that deviation of dated brent crude from the long  term average of     wa the best form of the variable to use  for prediction the brent forward curve produced by the global product group is used   the three new equation developed were   pllu  t   a  rpi  t   b  rpi  t  n   c   datedbrentcrude       constant  where n is    or   reddish curve  r  squared approx    f  stat approx  the chart below show what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation  and also the three best relation from before which were based upon current and future rpi  pllu  t   a  rpi  t   b  rpi  t  n   constant  where n is    or   greenish curve  r  squared approx    f  stat approx  comparison of model a you can see  the two equation differ in the very short  term and very long  term  the inclusion of deviation of brent crude lead to short  term prediction of     to     over the next six month  the greenish curve predict pllu in the range of     to     over the next six month  the curve are then very similar until   when the model including crude break  away to the upside  relative to the falling rpi curve  the model based purely on rpi hug the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term  this is only important to the extent that we have large position beyond   which we don  t   suggestion what could be useful now is a differently  specified model designed to forecast only the next  month  using auto  regressive or auto  regressive error term  this model would be far more accurate in the near  term  and we could include this information onto the front of this long  term model  this may be useful  despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time bucket  back  testing all the model give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used  based mainly on  s  new paradigm  economy   hopefully we can discus these and other point later in the tele  conference  your idea on this would be appreciated  regard  anjam x ,0
